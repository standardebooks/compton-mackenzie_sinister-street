			</hgroup>
			<p>The existence of the Seven Sisters Road had probably not occurred to Michael since in the hazel-coppices of Clere Abbey he had first made of it at Brother Aloysius’ behest the archetype of Avernus, and yet his choice of it now for entrance to the underworld was swift as instinct. The quest of Lily was already beginning to assume the character of a deliberate withdrawal from the world in which he familiarly moved. With the instant of his resolve all that in childhood and in youth he had apprehended of the dim territory, which in London sometimes lay no farther away than the other side of the road, demanded the trial of his experience.</p>
			<p>That he had never yet been to the Seven Sisters Road gave it a mystery; that it was not very far from Kentish Town gave it a gruesomeness, for ever since <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Pearcey’s blood-soaked perambulator Kentish Town had held for him a macaber significance: of the hellish portals mystery and gruesomeness were essential attributes. The drive was for a long time tediously pleasant in the June sunshine; but when the cab had crossed the junction of the Euston Road with the Tottenham Court Road, unknown London with all its sly and labyrinthine romance lured his fancy onward. Maple’s and Shoolbred’s, those outposts of shopping civilization, were left behind, and the Hampstead Road with a hint of roguery began. He was not sure what exactly made the Hampstead Road so disquieting. It was probably a mere trick of contrast between present squalor and the greenery of its end. The road itself was merely grim, but it had a nightmare capacity for suggesting that deviation by a foot from the thoroughfare itself would lead to obscure calamities. Those bright yellow omnibuses in which he had never traveled, how he remembered them from the days of Jack the Ripper, and the horror of them skirting the Strand by Trafalgar Square on winter dusks after the pantomime. Even now their painted destinations affected him with a dismay that real people could be familiar with this sinister route.</p>
			<p>Here was the Britannia, a terminus which had stuck in his mind for years as situate in some gray limbo of farthest London. Here it was, a tawdry and not very large public-house exactly like a hundred others. Now the cab was bearing round to the right, and presently upon an iron railway bridge Michael read in giant letters the direction Kentish Town behind a huge leprous hand pointing to the left. The hansom clattered through the murk beneath, past the dim people huddled upon the pavement, past a wheelbarrow and the obscene skeletons and outlines of humanity chalked upon the arches of sweating brick. Here then was Kentish Town. It lay to the left of this bridge that was the color of stale blood. Michael told the driver to stop for one moment, and he leaned forward over the apron of the cab to survey the cross-street of swarming feculent humanity that was presumably the entering highway. A train roared over the bridge; a piano organ gargled its tune; a wagon-load of iron girders drew near in a clanging tintamar of slow progress. Michael’s brief pause was enough to make such an impression of pandemoniac din as almost to drive out his original conception of Kentish Town as a menacing and gruesome suburb. But just as the cab reached the beginning of the Camden Road, he caught sight of a slop-shop where old clothes smothered the entrance with their mucid heaps and, just beyond, of three houses from whose surface the stucco was peeling in great scabs and the damp was oozing in livid arabesques and scrawls of verdigris. This group restored to Kentish Town a putative disquiet, and the impression of mere dirt and noise and exhalations of fried fish were merged in the more definite character allotted by his prefiguration.</p>
			<p>The Camden Road was, in contrast with what had gone before, a wide and easy thoroughfare which let in the blue summer sky; and it was not for some minutes that Michael began to notice what a queerness came from the terraces that branched off on either side. The suggestion these terraces could weave extended itself to the detached houses of the main road. In the gaps between them long parallelograms of gardens could be seen joining others even longer that led up to the backs of another road behind. Sometimes it seemed that fifty gardens at once were visible, circumscribed secretive pleasure-grounds in the amount of life they could conceal, the life that could prosper and decay beneath their arbors merely for that conspiracy of gloating windows. It was impossible not to speculate upon the quality of existence in these precise enclosures; and to this the chapels of obscure sects that the cab occasionally passed afforded an indication. To these arid little tabernacles the population stole out on Sunday mornings. There would be something devilish about these reunions. Upon these pinchbeck creeds their souls must surely starve, must slowly shrink to desiccated imps. Anything more spiritually malevolent than those announcements chalked upon the black notice-board of the advent of the hebdomadal messiah, the peregrine cleric, the sacred migrant was impossible to imagine. With what apostolic cleverness would he impose himself upon these people, and how after the gravid midday meal of the Sabbath he would sit in those green arbors like a horrible Chinese fum. The cabman broke in upon Michael’s fantastic depression by calling down through the trap that they were arrived at the Nag’s Head and what part of Seven Sisters Road did he want.</p>
			<p>Michael was disappointed by the Seven Sisters Road. It seemed to be merely the garish mart of a moderately poor suburban population. There was here nothing to support the diabolic legend with which under the suggestion of Brother Aloysius he had endowed it. Certainly of all the streets he had passed this afternoon there had been none less inferential of romance than this long shopping street.</p>
			<p>“What number do you want, sir?” the driver repeated.</p>
			<p>“Well, really I want rooms,” Michael explained. “Only this seems a bit noisy.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, it is a bit boisterous,” the cabman agreed.</p>
			<p>Michael told him to drive back along the Camden Road; but when he began to examine the Camden Road as a prospective place of residence, it became suddenly very dull and respectable. The locked-up chapels and the quiet houses declined from ominousness into respectability, and he wondered how he had managed only a quarter of an hour ago to speculate upon the inner life they adumbrated. Nothing could be less surreptitious than those chatting nursemaids, and actually in one of the parallelograms of garden a child was throwing a scarlet ball high into the air. The cab was already nearing the iron railway bridge of Kentish Town, and Michael had certainly no wish to lodge in a noisy slum.</p>
			<p>“Try turning off to the left,” he called to the driver through the roof.</p>
			<p>The maneuver seemed likely to be successful, for they entered almost immediately a district of Victorian terraces, where the name of each street was cut in stone upon the first house; and so fine and well-proportioned was each superscription that the houses’ declension from gentility was the more evident and melancholy.</p>
			<p>Michael was at last attracted to a crescent of villas terminating an unfrequented gray street and, for the sake of a pathetic privacy, guarded in front by a sickle-shaped enclosure of grimy Portugal laurels. Neptune Crescent, partly on account of its name and partly on account of the peculiar vitreous tint which the stone had acquired with age, carried a marine suggestion. The date 1805 in spidery numerals and the iron verandas, which even on this June day were a mockery, helped the illusion that here was a forgotten byway in an old seaport. A card advertising Apartments stood in the window of Number Fourteen. Michael signaled the driver to stop: then he alighted and rang the bell. The Crescent was strangely silent. Very far away he could hear the whistle of a train. Close at hand there was nothing but the jingle of the horse’s harness and the rusty mewing of a yellow cat which was wheedling its lean body in and out of the railings of the falciform garden.</p>
			<p>Soon the landlady opened the door and stood inquisitively in the narrow passage. She was a woman of probably about thirty-five with stubby fingers; her skin was rather moist, but she had a good-natured expression, and perhaps when the curl-papers were taken out from her colorless hair, and when lace frills and common finery should soften her turgid outlines she would be handsome in a labored sort of way. The discussion with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch about her vacant rooms did not take long. Michael had made up his mind to any horrors of dirt and discomfort, and he was really pleasantly surprised by their appearance. As for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, she was evidently too much interested to know what had brought Michael to her house to make any difficulties in the way of his accommodation.</p>
			<p>“Will you want dinner tonight?” she asked doubtfully.</p>
			<p>“No, but I’d like some tea now, if you can manage it; and I suppose you can let me have a latchkey?”</p>
			<p>“I’ve got the kettle on the boil at this moment. I was going out myself for the evening. Meeting my husband at the Horseshoe. There’s only one other lodger⁠—Miss Carlyle. And she’s in the profession.”</p>
			<p>As <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch made this announcement, she looked up at the fly-frecked ceiling, and Michael thought how extraordinarily light and meaningless her eyes were and how curiously dim and heavy this small sitting-room was against the brilliancy of the external summer.</p>
			<p>“Well, then, tea when I can get it,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch cheerfully. “And the double-u is just next your bedroom on the top floor. That’s all, I think.”</p>
			<p>She left him with a backward smile over her shoulder, as if she were loath to relinquish the study of this unusual visitor to Neptune Crescent.</p>
			<p>Michael when he was alone examined the chairs that were standing about the room as stiff as grenadiers in their red rep. He stripped them of their antimacassars and pulled the one that looked least uncomfortable close to the window. Outside, the yellow cat was still mewing; but the cab was gone and down the gray street that led to Neptune Crescent here and there sad-gaited wayfarers were visible. Two or three sparrows were cheeping in a battered laburnum, and all along the horizon the blue sky descending to the smoke of London had lost its color and had been turned to the similitude of tarnished metal. A luxurious mournfulness was in the view, and he leaned out over the sill scenting the reasty London air.</p>
			<p>It was with a sudden shock of conviction that Michael realized he was in Neptune Crescent, Camden Town, and that yesterday he had actually been in Oxford. And why was he here? The impulse which had brought him must have lain deeper in the recesses of his character than those quixotic resolutions roused by Drake’s legend of Lily. He would not otherwise have determined at once upon so complete a demigration. He would have waited to test the truth of Drake’s story. His first emotional despair had vanished with almost unaccountable ease. Certainly he wanted to be independent of the criticism of his friends until he had proved his purpose unwavering, and he might ascribe this withdrawal to a desire for a secluded and unflinching contemplation of a life that from Cheyne Walk he could never focus. But ultimately he must acknowledge that his sojourn here, following as it did straight upon his entrance into the underworld through the disappointing portals of the Seven Sisters Road, was due to that ancient lure of the shades. This experience was foredoomed from very infancy. It was designated in childish dreams to this day indelible. He could not remember any period in his life when the speculum of hidden thought had not reflected for his fear that shadow of evil which could overcast the manifestations of most ordinary existence. Those days of London fog when he had sat desolately in the pinched red house in Carlington Road; those days when on his lonely walks he had passed askance by Padua Terrace; the shouting of murders by newspaper-boys on drizzled December nights; all those dreadful intimations in childhood had procured his present idea of London. With the indestructible truth of earliest impressions they still persisted behind the outward presentation of a normal and comfortable procedure in the midst of money, friends, and well-bred conventions. Nor had that speculum been merely the half-savage fancy of childhood, the endowment by the young of material things with immaterial potencies. Phantoms which had slunk by as terrors invisible to the blind eyes of grownups had been abominably incarnate for him. Brother Aloysius had been something more than a mere personification, and that life which the ex-monk had indicated as scarcely even below the surface, so easy was it to enter, had he not entered it that one night very easily?</p>
			<p>Destiny, thought Michael, had stood with pointed finger beside the phantoms and the realities of the underworld. There for him lay very easily discernible the true corollary to the four years of Oxford. They had been years of rest and refreshment, years of armament with wise and academic and well-observed theories of behavior that would defeat the victory of evil. It was very satisfactory to discover definitely that he was not a Pragmatist. He had suspected all that crew of philosophers. He would bring back Lily from evil, not from any illusion of evil. He would not allow himself to disparage the problem before him by any speciousness of worldly convenience. It was imperative to meet Lily again as one who moving in the shadows meets another in the nether gloom. They had met first of all as boy and girl, as equals. Now he must not come too obviously from the world she had left behind her. Such an encounter would never give him more than at best a sentimental appeal; at worst it could have the air of a priggish reclamation, and she would forever elude him, she with secret years within her experience. His instinct first to sever himself from his own world must have been infallible, and it was on account of that instinct that now he found himself in Neptune Crescent leaning over the windowsill and scenting the reasty London air.</p>
			<p>And how well secluded was this room. If he met Lonsdale or Maurice or Wedderburn, it would be most fantastically amusing to evade them at the evening’s end, to retreat from their company into Camden Town; into Neptune Crescent unimaginable to them; into this small room with its red rep chairs and horsehair sofa and blobbed valances and curtains; to this small room where the dark blue wallpaper enclosed him with a matted vegetation and the picture of <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.painting">Belshazzar’s Feast</i> glowered above the heavy sideboard; to this small room made rich by the two thorny shells upon the mantelpiece, by the bowl of blond goldfish in ceaseless dim circumnatation, and by those colored pampas plumes and the bulrushes in their conch of nacreous glass.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch came in with tea which he drank while she stood over him admiringly.</p>
			<p>“Do you think you’ll be staying long?” she inquired.</p>
			<p>Michael asked if she wanted the rooms for anyone else.</p>
			<p>“No. No. I’m really very glad to let them. You’ll find it nice and quiet here. There’s only Miss Carlyle, who’s in the profession and comes in sometimes a little late. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch is a chemist. But of course he hasn’t got his own shop now.”</p>
			<p>She paused, and seemed to expect Michael would comment on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch’s loss of independence; so he said, “Of course not,” nodding wisely.</p>
			<p>“There was a bit of trouble through his being too kindhearted to a servant-girl,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, looking quickly at the door and shaking her curl-papers. “Yes. Though I don’t know why I’m telling you straight off as you might say. But there, I’m funny sometimes. If I take to anybody, there’s nothing I won’t do for them. Alf⁠—that <em>is</em> my old man⁠—he gets quite aggravated with me over it. So if you happen to get into conversation with him, you’d better not let on you know he used to have a shop of his own.”</p>
			<p>Michael, wondering how far off were these foreshadowed intimacies with his landlord, promised he would be very discreet, and asked where <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch was working now.</p>
			<p>“In a chemist’s shop. Just off of the Euston Road. You know,” she said, beaming archly. “It’s what you might call rather a funny place. Only he gets good money, because the boss knows he can trust him.”</p>
			<p>Michael nodded his head in solemn comprehension of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch’s reputation, and asked his landlady if she had such a thing as a postcard.</p>
			<p>“Well, there. I wonder if I have. If I have, it’s in the kitchen dresser, that’s a sure thing. Perhaps you’d like to come down and see the kitchen?”</p>
			<p>Michael followed her downstairs. There were no basements in Neptune Crescent, and he was glad to think his bedroom was above his sitting-room and on the top floor. It would have been hot just above the kitchen.</p>
			<p>“Miss Carlyle has her room here,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, pointing next door to the kitchen. “Nice and handy for her as she’s rather late sometimes. I hate to hear anybody go creaking upstairs, I do. It makes me nervous.”</p>
			<p>The kitchen was pleasant enough and looked out upon a narrow strip of garden full of coarse plants.</p>
			<p>“They’ll be very merry and bright, won’t they?” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, smiling encouragement at the greenery. “It’s wonderful what you can do nowadays for threepence.”</p>
			<p>Michael asked what they were.</p>
			<p>“Why, sunflowers, of course, only they want another month yet. I have them every year⁠—yes. They’re less trouble than rabbits or chickens. Now where did I see that postcard?”</p>
			<p>She searched the various utensils, and at last discovered the postcard stuck behind a mutilated clock.</p>
			<p>“What <em>will</em> they bring out next?” demanded <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, surveying it with affectionate approbation. “Pretty, I call it.”</p>
			<p>A pair of lovers in black plush were sitting enlaced beneath a pink frosted moon.</p>
			<p>“Just the thing, if you’re writing to your young lady,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, offering it to Michael.</p>
			<p>He accepted it with many expressions of gratitude, but when he was in his own room he laughed very much at the idea of sending it to his mother in Cheyne Walk. However, as he must write and tell her he would not be home for some time, he decided to go out and buy both writing materials and unillustrated postcards. When he came back he found <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch feathered for the evening’s entertainment. She gave him the latchkey, and from his window Michael watched her progress down Neptune Crescent. Just before her lavender dress disappeared behind the Portugal laurels she turned round and waved to him. He wondered what his mother would say if she knew from what curious corner of London the news of his withdrawal would reach her tonight.</p>
			<p>The house was very still, and the refulgence of the afternoon light streaming into the small room fused the raw colors to a fiery concordancy. Upon the silence sounded presently a birdlike fidgeting, and Michael going out onto the landing to discover what it was, caught to his surprise the upward glance of a thin little woman in untidy pink.</p>
			<p>“Hulloa!” she cried. “I never knew there was anybody in⁠—you did give me a turn. I’ve only just woke up.”</p>
			<p>Michael explained the situation, and she seemed relieved.</p>
			<p>“I’ve been asleep all the afternoon,” she went on. “But it’s only natural in this hot weather to go to sleep in the afternoon if you don’t go out for a walk. Why don’t you come down and talk to me while I have some tea?”</p>
			<p>Michael accepted the invitation with a courtesy which he half suspected this peaked pink little creature considered diverting.</p>
			<p>“You’ll excuse the general untidiness,” she said. “But really in this weather anyone can’t bother to put their things away properly.”</p>
			<p>Michael assented, and looked round at the room. It certainly was untidy. The large bed was ruffled where she had been lying down, and the soiled copy of a novelette gave it a sort of stale slovenry. Over the foot hung an accumulation of pink clothes. On the chairs, too, there were clothes pink and white, and the door bulged with numberless skirts. Miss Carlyle herself wore a pink blouse whose front had escaped the constriction of a belt. Even her face was a flat unshaded pink, and her thin lips would scarcely have showed save that the powder round the edges was slightly caked. Yet there was nothing of pink’s freshness and pleasant crudity in the general effect. It was a tired, a frowsy pink like a fondant that has lain a long while in a confectioner’s window.</p>
			<p>“Take a chair and make yourself at home,” she invited him. “What’s your name?”</p>
			<p>He told her “Fane.”</p>
			<p>“You silly thing, you don’t suppose I’m going to call you <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fane, do you? What’s your other name? Michael? That’s Irish, isn’t it? I used to know a fellow once called Micky Sullivan. I suppose they call you Micky at home.”</p>
			<p>He was afraid he was invariably known as Michael, and Miss Carlyle sighed at the stiff sort of a name it was.</p>
			<p>“Mine’s Poppy,” she volunteered. “That’s much more free and easy. Or I think so,” she added rather doubtfully, as Michael did not immediately celebrate its license by throwing pillows at her. “Are you really lodging here?” she went on. “You don’t look much like a pro.”</p>
			<p>Michael said that was so much the better, as he wasn’t one.</p>
			<p>“I’ve got you at last,” cried Poppy. “You’re a shop-walker at Russell’s.”</p>
			<p>He could not help laughing very much at this, and the queer pink room seemed to become more faded at the sound of his merriment. Poppy looked offended by the reception of her guess, and Michael hastened to restore her good temper by asking questions of her.</p>
			<p>“You’re on the stage, aren’t you?”</p>
			<p>“I usually get into panto,” she admitted.</p>
			<p>“Aren’t you acting now?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I don’t think. You needn’t be funny.”</p>
			<p>“I wasn’t trying to be funny.”</p>
			<p>“You mind your business,” she said bitterly. “And I’ll look after mine.”</p>
			<p>“There doesn’t seem to be anything very rude in asking if you’re acting now,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“Oh, shut up! As if you didn’t know.”</p>
			<p>“Know what?” he repeated.</p>
			<p>He looked so genuinely puzzled that Poppy seemed to make an effort to overcome her suspicion of his mockery.</p>
			<p>“It’s five years since I went on the game,” she said.</p>
			<p>Michael blushed violently, partly on her account, partly for his own stupidity, and explained that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch had told him she was in the profession.</p>
			<p>“Well, you didn’t expect her to say ‘my ground-floor front’s a gay woman,’ did you?”</p>
			<p>He agreed that such an abrupt characterization would have surprised him.</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m going out to get dinner now,” she announced.</p>
			<p>“Why don’t you dine with me?” Michael suggested.</p>
			<p>She looked at him doubtfully.</p>
			<p>“Can you afford it?”</p>
			<p>“I think I could manage it.”</p>
			<p>“Because if we <em>are</em> in the same house that doesn’t say you’ve got to pay my board, does it?” she demanded proudly.</p>
			<p>“Once in a way won’t matter,” Michael insisted. “And we might go on to a music hall afterward.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, we might, if I hadn’t got to pay the woman who’s looking after my kid for some clothes she’s made for him,” said Poppy. “And sitting with you at the Holborn all night won’t do that. No, you can give me dinner and then I’ll <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">P.O.</abbr> I’m not going to put on a frock even for you, because I never get off only when I’m in a coat and skirt.”</p>
			<p>Michael rose to leave the room while Poppy got ready.</p>
			<p>“Go on, sit down. As you’re going to take me out to dinner, you can talk to me while I dress as a reward.”</p>
			<p>In this faded pink room where the sun was by now shining with a splendor that made all the strewn clothes seem even more fusty and overblown, Michael could not have borne to see a live thing take shape as it were from such corruption. He made an excuse therefore of letters to be written and left Poppy to herself, asking to be called when she was ready.</p>
			<p>Michael’s own room upstairs had a real solidity after the ground-floor front. He wondered if it were possible that Lily was inhabiting at this moment such a room as Poppy’s. It could not be. It could not be. And he realized that he had pictured Lily like Manon in the midst of luxury, craving for magnificence and moving disdainfully before gilded mirrors. This Poppy Carlyle of Neptune Crescent belonged to another circle of the underworld. Lily would be tragical, but this little peaked creature downstairs was scarcely even pathetic. Indeed, she was almost grotesque with the coat and skirt that was to insure her getting off. Of course her only chance was to attract a jaded glance by her positive plainness, her schoolma’am air, her decent unobtrusiveness. Yet she was plucky, and she had accepted the responsibility of supporting her child. There was, too, something admirable in the candor with which she had treated him. There was something friendly and birdlike about her, and he thought how when he had been first aware of her movements below he had compared them to a bird’s fidgeting. There was something really appealing about the gay woman of the ground-floor front. He laughed at her description; and then he remembered regretfully that he had allowed her to forego what might after all have been for her a pleasant evening because she must pay for some clothes the woman who was looking after her child. He could so easily have offered to give her the money. No matter, he could make amends at once and offer it to her now. It would be doubtless an unusual experience for her to come into contact with someone whose rule of life was not dictated by the brutal self-interest of those with whom her commerce must generally lie. She would serve to bring to the proof his theory that so much of the world’s beastliness could be cleansed by having recourse to the natural instincts of decent behavior without any grand effort of reformation. Nevertheless, Michael did feel very philanthropic when he went down to answer Poppy’s summons.</p>
			<p>“I say,” he began at once. “It was stupid of me just now not to suggest that I should find the money for your kid’s clothes. Look here, we’ll go to the Holborn after dinner and⁠—” he paused. He felt a delicacy in inquiring how much exactly she might expect to lose by giving him her company⁠—“and⁠—er⁠—I suppose a couple of pounds would buy something?”</p>
			<p>“I say, kiddie, you’re a sport,” she said. “Only look here, don’t go and spend more than what you can afford. It isn’t as if we’d met by chance, as you might say.”</p>
			<p>“Oh no, I can afford two pounds,” Michael assured her.</p>
			<p>“Where shall we go? I know a nice room which the woman lets me have for four shillings. That’s not too much, is it?”</p>
			<p>He was touched by her eager consideration for his purse, and he stammered, trying to explain as gently as he could that the two pounds was not offered for hire.</p>
			<p>“But, kiddie, I can’t bring you back here. Not even if you do lodge here. These aren’t gay rooms.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t want to go anywhere with you,” said Michael. “The money is a present.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, is it?” she flamed out. “Then you can keep your dirty money. Thanks, I haven’t come down to charity. Not yet. If I’m not good enough for you, you can keep your money. I believe you’re nothing more than a dirty ponce. I’ve gone five years without keeping a fellow yet. And I’m not going to begin now. That’s very certain. Are you going out or am I going out? Because I don’t want to be seen with you. You and your presents. Gard! I should have to be drunk on claret and lemon before I went home with you.”</p>
			<p>Michael had nothing to say to her and so he went out, closing the front door quickly upon her rage. His first impression when he gained the fresh air was of a fastidious disgust. Here in the Crescent the orange lucency of the evening shed such a glory that the discoloration of the houses no longer spoke of miserably drawn-out decay, but took on rather the warmth of live rock. The deepening shadows of that passage where the little peaked creature had spat forth her fury made him shudder with the mean and vicious passions they now veiled. Very soon, however, his disgust died away. Looking back at Neptune Crescent, he knew there was not one door in all that semicircle which did not putatively conceal secrets like those of Number Fourteen. Like poisonous toadstools in rankness and gloom, the worst of human nature must flourish here. It was foolish to be disgusted; indeed, already a half-aroused curiosity had taken its place, and Michael regretted that he had not stayed to hear what more she would have said. How far she had been from appreciating the motives that prompted his offer of money. Poppy’s injustice began to depress him. He felt, walking southward to Piccadilly, an acute sense of her failure to be grateful from his point of view. It hurt him to find sincerity so lightly regarded. Then he realized that it was her vanity which had been touched. <em>Hell knows no fury like a woman scorned.</em> The ability to apply such a famous generalization directly to himself gave Michael a great satisfaction. It was strange to be so familiar with a statement, and then suddenly like this to be staggered by its truth. He experienced a sort of pride in linking himself on to one of the great commonplaces of rhetoric. He need no longer feel misjudged, since Poppy had played a universal part. In revulsion he felt sorry for her. He hated to think how deeply her pride must have been wounded. He could not expect her to esteem the reason which had made him refuse her. She could have little comprehension of fastidiousness and still less could she grasp the existence of an abstract morality that in its practical expression must have seemed to her so insulting. That, however, did not impugn the morality, nor did it invalidate the desire to befriend her. Impulse had not really betrayed him: the mistake had been in his tactlessness, in a lack of worldly knowledge. Moreover, Poppy was only an incident, and until Lily was found he had no business to turn aside. Nevertheless, he had learned something this evening; he had seen proved in action a famous postulate of feminine nature, and the truth struck him with a sharpness that no academic demonstration had ever had the power to effect.</p>
			<p>On the whole, Michael was rather pleased with himself as he rode on the front seat of the omnibus down Tottenham Court Road in the cool of the evening.</p>
			<p>At the Horseshoe he alighted and went into the saloon bar on the chance of seeing what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch looked like; but there was no sign of the landlady and her husband. The saloon bar smelt very strongly of spilt stout; and a number of men, who looked like draymen in tailcoats and top-hats, were arguing about money. He was glad to leave the tavern behind; and in a Soho restaurant he ate a tranquil dinner, listening with much amusement to the people round him. He liked to hear each petty host assure his guests that he had brought them to a place of which very few but himself knew. All the diners under the influence of this assurance stared at one another like conspirators.</p>
			<p>Just before nine o’clock. Michael reached the Orient Palace of Varieties, and with excitement bubbling up within him, notwithstanding all his efforts to stay unmoved, he joined the throng of the Promenade. He looked about him at first in trepidation. Although all the way from Camden Town he had practiced this meeting with Lily, now at its approach his presence of mind vanished, and he felt that to meet her suddenly without a longer preparation would lead him to make a fool of himself. However, in the first quick glance he could not see anyone who resembled her, and he withdrew to the secluded apex of the curving Promenade whence he could watch most easily the ebb and flow of the crowd. That on the stage a lady of the haute école was with a curious wooden rapidity putting a white horse through a number of tricks did not concern his attention beyond the moment. For him the Promenade was the performance. Certainly at the Orient it was a better staged affair than that weary heterogeneous mob at The Oxford. At the Orient there was an unity of effect, an individuality, and a conscious equipment. At The Oxford the whole business had resembled a suburban parade. Here was a real exposition of vice like the jetty of Alexandria in olden days. Indeed, so cynical was the function of the Orient Promenade that the frankness almost defeated its object, and the frequenters instead of profiting by the facilities for commerce allowed themselves to be drugged into perpetual meditation upon an attractive contingency.</p>
			<p>Seen from this secluded corner, the Promenade resembled a well-filled tank in an aquarium. The upholstery of shimmering green plush, the dim foreground, the splash of light from the bar in one corner, the gliding circumambient throng among the pillars and, displayed along the barrier, the bright-hued ladies like sea-anemones⁠—there was nothing that spoiled the comparison. Moreover, the longer Michael looked, the more nearly was the effect achieved. At intervals women whose close-fitting dresses seemed deliberately to imitate scales went by: and generally the people eyed one another with the indifferent frozen eyes of swimming fish. There was indeed something cold-blooded in the very atmosphere, and it was from, this rapacious and vivid shoal of women that he was expecting Lily to materialize. Yet he was better able to imagine her in the luxury of the Orient than sleeping down the sun over a crumpled novelette in such a room as Poppy’s in Camden Town.</p>
			<p>The evening wore itself away, and the motion in that subaqueous air was restful in its continuity. Michael was relieved by the assurance that he had still a little time in which to compose himself to face the shock he knew he must ultimately expect from meeting Lily again. The evening wore itself away. The lady of the haute école was succeeded by a band of Caucasian wrestlers, by a troupe of Bolivian gymnasts, by half a dozen cosmopolitan ebullitions of ingenuity. The ballet went its mechanical course, and as each line of dancers grouped themselves, it was almost possible to hear the click of the kaleidoscope’s shifting squares and lozenges. Michael wondered vaguely about the girls in the ballet and whether they were happy. It seemed absurd to think that down there on the stage there were eighty or ninety individuals each with a history, so little more did they seem from here than dolls. And on the Promenade where it was quite certain that every woman had a history to account for her presence there, how utterly living had quenched life. The ballet was over, and he passed out into the streets.</p>
			<p>For a fortnight Michael came every evening to the Orient without finding Lily. They were strange evenings, these that were spent in the heart of London without meeting anyone he knew. It was no doubt by the merest chance that none of his friends saw him at the Orient, and yet he began to fancy that actually every evening he did, as it were, by some enchantment fade from the possibility of recognition. He felt as if his friends would not perceive his presence, so much would they in that circumambient throng take on the characteristics of its eternal motion. They too, he felt, irresponsive as fish, would glide backward and forward with the rest. Nor did Michael meet anyone whom he knew at any of the restaurants or cafés to which he went after the theater. By the intensity of his one idea, the discovery of Lily, he cut himself off from all communion with the life of the places he visited. He often thought that perhaps acquaintances saw him there, that perhaps he had seemed deliberately to avoid their greetings and for that reason had never been hailed. Yet he was aware of seeing women whom he had seen the night before, mostly because they bore a superficial likeness to Lily; and sometimes he would be definitely conscious of a dress or a hat, perceiving it in the same place at the same hour, but never meeting the wearer’s glance.</p>
			<p>He did not make any attempt to be friendly with Poppy after their unpleasant encounter, and he always tried to be sure they would not meet in the hall or outside the front door. That he was successful in avoiding her gave him a still sharper sense of the ease with which it was possible to seclude one’s self from the claims of human intercourse. He was happy in his room at Neptune Crescent, gazing out over the sickle-shaped garden of Portugal laurels, listening in a dream to the distant cries of railway traffic and reading the books which every afternoon he brought back from Charing Cross Road, so many books indeed that presently the room in 14 Neptune Crescent came curiously to resemble rooms in remote digs at Oxford, where poor scholars imposed their books on surroundings they could not afford to embellish. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch could not make Michael out at all. She used to stand and watch him reading, as if he were performing an intricate surgical operation.</p>
			<p>“I never in all my life saw anyone read like you do,” she affirmed. “Doesn’t it tire your eyes?”</p>
			<p>Then she would move a step nearer and spell out the title of the book, looking sideways at it like a fat goose.</p>
			<p>“<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Holy Living and Holy Dying</i>. Ugh! Enough to give you the horrors, isn’t it? And only this morning they hung that fellow at Pentonville. This <em>is</em> Tuesday, isn’t it?”</p>
			<p>After three or four days of trying to understand him, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch decided that Alf must be called in to solve his peculiarity.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Alfred Murdoch was younger than Michael had expected. He could scarcely have been more than forty, and Michael had formed a preconception of an elderly chemist reduced by misfortune and misdeeds to the status of one of those individuals who with a discreet manner somewhere between a family doctor and a grocer place themselves at the service of the public in an atmosphere of antiseptics. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch was not at all like this. He was a squat swarthy man with one very dark eye that stared fixedly regardless of the expression of its fellow. Michael could not make up his mind whether this eye were blind or not. He rather hoped it was, but in any case its fierce blankness was very disconcerting. Conversation between Michael and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch was not very lively, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch’s adjutant inquisitiveness made Michael the more monosyllabic whenever her husband did commit himself to a direct inquiry.</p>
			<p>“I looked for you in the Horseshoe the other evening,” said Michael finally, at a loss how in any other way to give <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch an impression that he took the faintest interest in his existence.</p>
			<p>“In the Horseshoe?” repeated <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch, in surprise. “I never go to the Horseshoe only when a friend asks me in to have one.”</p>
			<p>Michael saw <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch frowning at him, and, perceiving that there was a reason why her husband must not suppose she had been to the Horseshoe on the evening of his arrival, he said he had gathered somehow, he did not exactly know where or why or when, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch was often to be found in the Horseshoe. He wished this awkward and unpleasant man would leave him and cock his rolling eye anywhere else but in his room.</p>
			<p>“Bit of a reader, aren’t you?” inquired the chemist.</p>
			<p>Michael admitted he read a good deal.</p>
			<p>“Ever read Jibbon’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>?” continued the chemist.</p>
			<p>“Some of it.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch said in that case it was just as well he hadn’t bought some volumes he’d seen on a barrow in the Caledonian Road.</p>
			<p>“Four-and-six, with two books out in the middle,” he proclaimed.</p>
			<p>Michael could merely nod his comment, though he racked his brains to think of some remark that would betray a vestige of cordiality. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch got up to retire to the kitchen. He evidently did not find his tenant sympathetic. Outside on the landing Michael heard him say to his wife: “Stuck up la-di-da sort of a ⸻, isn’t he?”</p>
			<p>Presently the wife came up again.</p>
			<p>“How did you like my old man?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, very much.”</p>
			<p>“Did you notice his eye?”</p>
			<p>Michael said he had noticed something.</p>
			<p>“His brother Fred did that for him.”</p>
			<p>She spoke proudly, as if Fred’s act had been a humane achievement. “When they were boys,” she explained. “It gives him a funny look. I remember when I first met him it gave me the creeps, but I don’t notice it really now. Would you believe he couldn’t see an elephant with it?”</p>
			<p>“I wondered if it were blind,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“Blind as a leg of mutton,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, and still there lingered in her accents a trace of pride. Then suddenly her demeanor changed and there crept over her countenance what Michael was bound to believe to be an expression of coyness.</p>
			<p>“Don’t say anything more to Alf about the Horseshoe. You see, I only gave you the idea I was meeting him, because I didn’t really know you very well at the time. Of course really I’d gone to see my sister. No, without a joke, I was spending the evening with a gentleman friend.”</p>
			<p>Michael looked at her in astonishment.</p>
			<p>“My old man wouldn’t half knock me about, if he had the least suspicion. But it’s someone I knew before I was married, and that makes a difference, doesn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“Does your husband go out with lady friends he knew before he was married?” Michael asked, and wondered if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch would see an implied reproof.</p>
			<p>“What?” she shrilled. “I’d like to catch him nosing after another woman. He wouldn’t see a hundred elephants before I’d done with him. I’d show him.”</p>
			<p>“But why should you have freedom and not he?” Michael asked.</p>
			<p>“Never mind about him. You let him try. You see what he’d get.”</p>
			<p>Michael did not think the argument could be carried on very profitably. So he showed signs of wanting to return to his book, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch retired. What extraordinary standards she had, and how bitterly she was prepared to defend a convention, for after all in such a marriage the infidelity of the husband was nothing but a conventional offense: she obviously had no affection for him. The point of view became very topsyturvy in Neptune Crescent, Michael decided.</p>
			<p>On the last evening of the fortnight during which he had regularly visited the Orient, Michael went straight back to Camden Town without waiting to scan the cafés and restaurants until half-past twelve as he usually had. This abode in Neptune Crescent was empty, and as always when that was the case the personality of the house was very vivid upon his imagination. As he turned up the gas-jet in the hall, the cramped interior with its fusty smell and its threadbare staircarpet disappearing into the upper gloom round the corner seemed to be dreadfully closing in upon him. The old house conveyed a sense of having the power to choke out of him every sane and orderly and decent impulse. For a whim of tristfulness, for the luxury of consummating the ineffable depression the house created in him, Michael prepared to glance at every one of the five rooms. The front door armed with the exaggerated defenses of an earlier period in building tempted him to lock and double-lock it, to draw each bolt and to fasten the two clanking chains. He had the fantastic notion to do this so that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch and Poppy might stay knocking and ringing outside in the summer night, while himself escaped into the sunflowers of the back garden and went climbing over garden wall and garden wall to abandon this curious mixture of salacity and respectableness, of flimsiness and solidity, this quite indefinably raffish and sinister and yet in a way strangely cozy house. He opened gingerly the door of the ground-floor front. He peered cautiously in, lest Poppy should be lying on her bed. The gas-jet was glimmering with a scarcely perceptible pinhead of blue flame, but the light from the passage showed all her clothes still strewn about. From the open door came out the faint perfume of stale scent which mingled with the fusty odor of the passage in a most subtle expression of the house’s personality. He closed the door gently. In the silence it seemed almost as if the least percussion would rouse the very clothes from their stupor of disuse. In the kitchen was burning another pinhead of gas, and the light from the passage reaching here very dimly was only just sufficient to give all the utensils a ghostly sheen and to show the mutilated hands at a quarter past five upon the luminous face of the clock. This unreal hour added the last touch to unreality, and when Michael went upstairs and saw the books littering his room, even they were scarcely sound guarantors of his own actuality. He had a certain queasiness in opening the door of the Murdochs’ bedroom, and he was rather glad when he was confronted here by a black void whose secrecy he did not feel tempted to violate. With three or four books under his arm he went upstairs to bed. As he leaned out of the window two cats yawled and fizzed at one another among the laurels, and then scampered away into muteness. From a scintillation of colored lights upon the horizon he could hear the scrannel sounds of the railway come thinly along the night air. Nothing else broke the silence of the nocturnal streets. Michael felt tired, and he was disappointed by his failure to find Lily. Just as he was dozing off, he remembered that his Viva Voce at Oxford was due some time this week. He must go back to Cheyne Walk tomorrow, and on this resolution he fell asleep.</p>
			<p>Michael woke up with a start and instantly became aware that the house was full of discordant sounds. For a minute or two he lay motionless trying to connect the noise with the present, trying to separate his faculties from the inspissate air that seemed to be throttling them. He was not yet free from the confusion of sleep, and for a few seconds he could only perceive the sound almost visibly churning the clotted darkness that was stifling him. Gradually the clamor resolved itself into the voices of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch and Poppy at the pitch of excitement. Nothing was intelligible except the oaths that came up in a series of explosions detached from the main din. He got out of bed and lit the gas, saw that it was one o’clock, dressed himself roughly, and opened the door of his room.</p>
			<p>“Yes, my lad, you thought you was very clever.”</p>
			<p>“No, I didn’t think I was clever. Now then.”</p>
			<p>“Yes! You can spend all your money on that muck. The sauce of it. In a hansom!”</p>
			<p>Here Poppy’s voice came in with a malignant piping sound.</p>
			<p>“Muck yourself, you dirty old case-keeper!”</p>
			<p>“You call me a case-keeper? What men have I ever let you bring back here?”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch’s voice was swollen with wrath.</p>
			<p>“You don’t know how many men I haven’t brought back. So now, you great ugly mare!” Poppy howled.</p>
			<p>“The only fellow you’ve ever brought to my house is that one-eyed ⸻ who calls himself my husband. Mister <em>Mur</em>doch! Mister <em>Murdoch!</em> And you get out of my house in the streets where you belong. I don’t want no two-and-fours in <em>my</em> house.”</p>
			<p>“Hark at her!” Poppy cried, in a horrible screaming laugh. “Why don’t you go back on the streets yourself? Why, I can remember you as one of the old fourpenny Hasbeens when I was still dressmaking; a dirty drunken old teat that couldn’t have got off with a blind tramp.”</p>
			<p>Michael punctuated each fresh taunt and accusation with a step forward to interfere; and every time he held himself back, pondering the impossibility of extracting from these charges and countercharges any logical assignment of blame. It made him laugh to think how extraordinarily in the wrong they all three were and at the same time how they were all perfectly convinced they were right. The only factor left out of account was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch’s own behavior. He wondered rather what effect that gentleman friend would produce on the husband. He decided that he had better go back to bed until the racket subsided. Then, just as he was turning away in the midst of an outpouring of vileness far more foul than anything uttered so far, he heard what sounded like a blow. That of course could not be tolerated, and he descended to intervene.</p>
			<p>The passage was the field of battle, and the narrow space seemed to give not only an added virulence to the fight, but also an added grotesquery. When Michael arrived at the head of the staircase, Alf had pinned his wife to the wall and was shouting to Poppy over his shoulder to get back into her own room. Poppy would go halfway, but always a new insult would occur to her, and she would return to fling it at <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, stabbing the while into its place again a hatpin which during her retreats she always half withdrew.</p>
			<p>As for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch, she was by now weeping hysterically and occasionally making sudden forward plunges that collapsed like jelly.</p>
			<p>Michael paused at the head of the stairs, wondering what to say. It seemed to him really rather a good thing that Alf was restraining his wife. It would be extremely unpleasant to have to separate the two women if they closed with each other. He had almost decided to retire upstairs again, when Poppy caught sight of him and at once turned her abuse in his direction.</p>
			<p>“What’s it got to do with you?” she screamed. “What’s the good in you standing gaping there? We all know what <em>you</em> are. We all know what she’s always going up to <em>your</em> room for.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch was heaving and puffing and groaning, and while Alf held her, his rolling eye with fierce and meaningless stare nearly made Michael laugh. However, he managed to be serious, and gravely advised Poppy to go to bed.</p>
			<p>“Don’t you dare try to order me about!” she shrieked. “Keep your poncified ways for that fat old maggot which her husband can’t hardly hold, and I don’t blame him. She’s about as big as a omnibus.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, you wicked woman,” sobbed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch. “Oh, you mean, hateful snake-in-the-grass! Oh, you filth!”</p>
			<p>“Hold your jaw,” commanded Alf. “If you don’t want me to punch into you.”</p>
			<p>“All day she’s in his room. Let him stand up and deny it if he can, the dirty tyke. Why don’t you punch into <em>him</em>, Alf?” Poppy screamed.</p>
			<p>Still that wobbling eye, blank and ferocious, was fixed upon vacancy.</p>
			<p>“Let <em>me</em> look after <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch I <em>don’t</em> think!” shouted Poppy. “And be a man, even if you can’t keep your old woman out of the lodger’s room. ⸻ ⸻! I wouldn’t half slosh his jaw in, if I was a man, the ⸻ ⸻!”</p>
			<p>It was a question for Michael either of laughing outright or of being nauseated at the oaths streaming from that little woman’s thin magenta lips. He laughed. Even with her paint, she still looked so respectable. When he began to laugh, he laughed so uncontrollably that he had to hold on to the rail of the balusters until they rattled like ribs.</p>
			<p>Michael’s laughter stung the group to frenzied action. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch spat in her husband’s face, whereupon he immediately loosed his grip upon her shoulders. In a moment she and Poppy were clawing each other. Michael, though he was still laughing unquenchably, rushed downstairs to part them. He had an idea that both of the women instantly turned and attacked him. The hatstand fell over: the scurfy front-door mat slid up and down the oil cloth: there was a reek of stale scent and dust and spirituous breath.</p>
			<p>At last Michael managed to secure Poppy’s thin twitching arms and to hold her fast, though she was kicking him with sharp-heeled boots and he was weak with inward laughter. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch in the lull began fecklessly to gather together the strands of her disordered hair. Alf, who had gone to peep from the window of the ground-floor front in case a policeman’s bull’s-eye were glancing on Neptune Crescent, reappeared in the doorway.</p>
			<p>“What a smell of gas!” he exclaimed nervously.</p>
			<p>There was indeed a smell of gas, and Michael remembered that Poppy in her struggle had grasped the bracket. She must have dislocated the lead pipe rather badly, for the light was already dimming and the gas was rushing out fast. The tumultuous scene was allayed. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Murdoch hurried to cut off the main. Poppy retired into her room, slammed and locked the door. Michael went upstairs to bed, and just as darkness descended upon the house he saw his landlady painfully trying to raise the hatstand, while with the other arm she felt aimlessly for strands of tumbled hair.</p>
			<p>Next morning Michael was surprised to see <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch enter very cheerfully with his tea; her hair that so short a time since had seemed eternally intractable had now shriveled into subjugatory curl-papers: of last night’s tear-smudged face remained no memory in this beaming countenance.</p>
			<p>“Quite a set-out we had last night, didn’t we?” she said expansively. “But that Poppy, really, you know, she is the limit. Driving home with my old man in a hansom cab. There’s a nice game to get up to. I was bound to let her have it. I couldn’t have held myself in.”</p>
			<p>“I suppose you’ll get rid of her now,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“Oh, well, she’s not so bad in some ways, and very quiet as a rule. She was a bit canned last night, and I suppose I’d had one or two myself. Oh, well, it wouldn’t do, would it, if we never had a little enjoyment in this life?”</p>
			<p>She left him wondering how he would ever be able to readjust his standards to the topsyturvy standards of the underworld, the topsyturvy feuds and reconciliations, the hatreds; the loves and jealousies and fears. But today he must leave this looking-glass world for a time.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch was very much upset by his departure from Neptune Crescent.</p>
			<p>“It seems such a pity,” she said. “And just as I was beginning to get used to your ways. Oh, well, we’ll meet again some day, I hope, this side of the cemetery.”</p>
			<p>Michael felt some misgivings about ordering a hansom after last night, but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Murdoch went cheerfully enough to fetch one. He drove away from Neptune Crescent, waving to her where she stood in the small doorway looking very large under that rusty frail veranda. He also waved rather maliciously to Poppy, as he caught sight of her sharp nose pressed against the panes of the ground-floor front.</p>
