				<p epub:type="title">Holidays in France</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>In Michael’s last term at <abbr>St.</abbr> James’ Preparatory School, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane settled that he should for the holidays go to France with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge, two masters who were accustomed each year to take a few boys away with them to the coast of Brittany. Five boys were going this summer⁠—Michael and Hands and Hargreaves and Jubb and Rutherford; and all five of them bragged about their adventure for days before school broke up. Miss Carthew drove with Michael to Victoria Station and handed him over to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge who was walking about in a very thick and romantic overcoat. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge was a clean-shaven, large-faced and popular master, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon was an equally popular master, deep-voiced, heavy-moustached, hook-nosed. In fact it was impossible to say which of the two one liked the better. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge at once produced two packets of Mazawattee tea which he told Michael to put in his pocket and say nothing about when he landed in France, and when Hands, Hargreaves, Rutherford and Jubb arrived, they were all given packets of tea by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge and told to say nothing about them when they landed in France. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon appeared, looking very businesslike and shouting directions about the luggage to porters, while <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge gathered the boys together and steered them through the barrier on to the platform and into the train for Newhaven. The steamer by which they were going to cross was not an ordinary packet-boat, but a cargo-boat carrying vegetable ivory. For Channel voyagers they were going to be a long while at sea, calling at Havre and afterwards rounding Cherbourg and Brest, before they reached <abbr>St.</abbr> Corentin, the port of their destination at the mouth of the Loire. It was rough weather all the way to Havre, and Michael was too ill to notice much the crew or the boat or any of the other boys. However, the excitement of disembarking at Havre about midnight put an end to seasickness, for it was very thrilling at such an hour to follow <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon through the gloomy wharves and under their dripping archways. When after this strange walk, they came to a wide square and saw cafés lighted up and chairs and tables in the open air before the doors, Michael felt that life was opening out on a vista of hitherto unimagined possibilities. They all sat down at midnight, wrapped up in their travelling coats and not at all too much tired to sip <i xml:lang="fr">grenadine sucrée</i> and to crunch Petit Beurre biscuits. Michael thought <i xml:lang="fr">grenadine sucrée</i> was just as nice as it looked and turned to Hands, a skull-headed boy who was sitting next to him:</p>
			<p>“I say, this is awfully decent, isn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“Rather,” squeaked Hands in his high voice. “Much nicer than Pineappleade.”</p>
			<p>After they had stayed there for a time, watching isolated passersby slouch across the windblown square, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge announced they must hurry back to the boat and get a good night’s sleep. Back they went between the damp walls of the shadowy wharves, plastered with unfamiliar advertisements, until they reached their boat and went to bed. In the morning when Michael woke up, the steamer was pitching and rolling: everything in the cabin was lying in a jumble on the floor, and Rutherford and Hargreaves were sitting up in their bunks wideawake. Rutherford was the oldest boy of the party and he was soon going in for his Navy examination; but he had been so seasick the day before that Michael felt that he was just as accessible as the others and was no longer afraid to talk to this hero without being spoken to first. Rutherford, having been so sick, felt bound to put on a few airs of grandeur; but he was pleasant enough and very full of information about many subjects which had long puzzled Michael. He spoke with authority on life and death and birth and love and marriage, so that when Michael emerged into the wind from the jumbled cabin, he felt that to dress beside Rutherford was an event not easily to be forgotten: but later on as he paced the foam-spattered deck, and meditated on the facts of existence so confidently revealed, he began to fear that the learned Rutherford was merely a retailer of unwarranted legends. Still he had propounded enough for Michael, when he returned to Carlington Road, to theorize upon and impart to the Macalisters; and anyway, without bothering about physiological problems, it was certainly splendid to walk about the deck in the wind and rain, and no longer to hate, but even to enjoy the motion of the boat. It was exhilarating to clamber right up into the bows among coils of rope and to see how the boat charged through the spuming water. Michael nearly made up his mind to be a sailor instead of a Bengal Lancer, and looked enviously at the ship’s boy in his blue blouse. But presently he heard a savage voice, and one of the sailors so much admired kicked the ship’s boy down the companion into the forecastle. Michael was horrified when, late in the grey and stormy afternoon, he heard cries of pain from somewhere down below. He ran to peer into the pit whence they came, and in the half-light he could see a rope’s-end clotted with blood. This sight dismayed him, and he longed to ask <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge or <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon to interfere and save the poor ship’s boy, but a feeling of shame compelled silence and, though he was sincerely shocked by the thought of the cruel scenes acted down there in the heart of the ship, he could not keep back a certain exultation and excitement similar to that which he had felt at Folkestone in the girls’ school last summer.</p>
			<p>Soon the steamer with its cargo of vegetable ivory and tortured ship’s boy and brutal crew were all forgotten in the excitement of arriving at <abbr>St.</abbr> Corentin, of driving miles into the country until they reached the house where they were going to spend six weeks. It was an old house set far back from the high road and reached by a long drive between pollarded acacias. All round the house were great fig trees and pear trees and plum trees. The garden was rank with unpruned gooseberry and currant bushes, untidy with scrambling gourds and grape vines. It was a garden utterly unlike any garden that Michael had ever known. There seemed to be no flowers in this overwhelming vegetation which matted everything. It was like the garden of the Sleeping Beauty’s palace. The crumbling walls were webbed with briars; their foundations were buried in thickets of docks and nettles, and the fruit trees that grew against them had long ago broken loose from any restraint. It was a garden that must surely take a very long time to explore, so vast was it, so trackless, so much did every corner demand a slow advance.</p>
			<p>When the boys had unpacked and when they had been introduced to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Wylde, the mistress of the house, and when they had presented to her the packets of Mazawattee tea and when they themselves had eaten a deliciously novel dinner at the unusual hour of six, they all set out to explore the luxuriant wilderness behind the house. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge shouted to them to eat only the ripe fruit and with this solitary injunction left them to their own amusements until bedtime. Rutherford, Hargreaves and Jubb at once set out to find ripe fruit, and as the first tree they came to was loaded with greengages, Rutherford, Hargreaves and Jubb postponed all exploration for the present. Michael and Hands, who was sleeping in his room and with whom he had already made friends, left the others behind them. As they walked farther from the house, they spoke in low tones, so silent was this old garden.</p>
			<p>“I’m sure it’s haunted,” said Michael. “I never felt so funny, not exactly frightened, you know, but sort of frightened.”</p>
			<p>“It’s still quite light,” squeaked the hopeful Hands.</p>
			<p>“Yes, but the sun’s behind all these trees and you can’t hear anything, but only us walking,” whispered Michael.</p>
			<p>However, they went on through a jungle of artichokes and through an orchard of gnarled apple trees past a mildewed summerhouse, until they reached a serpentine path between privet bushes, strongly scented in the dampness all around.</p>
			<p>“Shall we?” murmured Hands doubtfully.</p>
			<p>“Yes. We can bunk back if we see anything,” said Michael. “I like this.”</p>
			<p>They walked on following the zigzags of the path, but stopped dead as a blackbird shrilled and flapped into the bushes affrighted.</p>
			<p>“By Jove, that beastly bird made me awfully funky,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“Let’s go back,” said Hands. “Suppose we got murdered. People do in France.”</p>
			<p>“Rot,” said Michael. “Not in a private garden, you cuckoo.”</p>
			<p>With mutual encouragement the two boys wandered on, until they found farther progress barred by a high hedge, impenetrable apparently and viewless to Michael and Hands who were not very tall.</p>
			<p>“What sucks!” said Michael. “I hate turning back. I think it’s rotten to turn back. Don’t you? Hullo!” he cried. “Look here, Hands. Here’s a regular sort of tunnel going down hill. It’s quite steep.”</p>
			<p>In a moment Hands and Michael were half sliding, half climbing down a cliff. The lower they went, the faster they travelled and soon they were sliding all the way, because they had to guard their faces against the brambles that twined above them.</p>
			<p>“Good Lord!” gasped Michael, as he bumped down a sheer ten-feet of loose earth. “I’m getting jolly bumped. Look out, Hands, you kicked my neck, you ass.”</p>
			<p>“I can’t help it,” gasped Hands. “I’m absolutely slipping, and if I try to catch hold, I scratch myself.”</p>
			<p>They were sliding so fast that the only thing to do was to laugh and give way. So, with shouts and laughter and bumps and jolts and the pushing of loose stones and earth before them, Michael and Hands came with a run to the bottom of the cliff and landed at last on soft sea-sand.</p>
			<p>“By gum,” said Michael, “we’re right on the beach. What a rag!”</p>
			<p>The two boys looked back to the scene of their descent. It was a high cliff covered with shrubs and brambles, apparently unassailable. Before them was the sea, pale blue and gold, and to the right and to the left were the flat lonely sands. They ran, shouting with excitement, towards the rippling tide. The sand-hoppers buzzed about their ankles: Hands tripped over a jellyfish and fell into several others: seagulls swooped above them, crying continually.</p>
			<p>“It’s like <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Robinson Crusoe</i>,” Michael declared.</p>
			<p>He was mad with the exhilaration of possession. He owned these sands.</p>
			<p>“Oh, young Hands fell down on the sands,” he cried, bursting into uncontrollable laughter at the absurdity of the rhyme. Then he found razor-shells and waved his arms triumphantly. He found, too, wine-stained shells and rosy shells and great purple mussels. He and Hands took off their shoes and stockings and ran through the limpid water that sparkled with gold and tempted them to wade forever ankle deep. They reached a broken mass of rock which would obviously be surrounded by water at high tide; they clambered up to the summit and found there grass and rabbits’ holes.</p>
			<p>“It’s a real island,” said Michael. “It is! I say, Hands, this is our island. We discovered it. Bags I, we keep it.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t let’s get caught by the tide,” suggested cautious Hands.</p>
			<p>“All right, you funk,” jeered Michael.</p>
			<p>They came back to the level sands and wandered on towards the black point of cliff bounding the immediate view.</p>
			<p>“I say, there’s a cave. I bet you there’s a cave,” Michael called to his companion who was examining a dead fish.</p>
			<p>“Wait a jiffy,” shouted Hands; but Michael hurried on to the cave. He wanted to be the first to enter under its jagged arch. Already he could see the silver sand shimmering upon the threshold of the inner darkness. He walked in, awed by the secrecy of this sea-cavern, almost expectant of a mermaid or octopus in the deepest cranny. Suddenly he stopped. His heart beat furiously: his head swam: his legs quivered under him. Then he turned and ran towards the light.</p>
			<p>“Good lummy!” said Hands, when Michael came up to him. “Whatever’s the matter? You’re simply frightfully white.”</p>
			<p>“Come away,” said Michael. “I saw something beastly.”</p>
			<p>“What was it?”</p>
			<p>“There’s a man in there and a woman. Oh, it was beastly.”</p>
			<p>Michael dragged Hands by the arm, but not before they had left the cave far behind would he speak.</p>
			<p>“What was it really?” asked Hands, when they stood at the bottom of the cliff.</p>
			<p>“I couldn’t possibly tell anybody ever,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“You’re making it up,” scoffed Hands.</p>
			<p>“No, I’m not,” said Michael. “Look here, don’t say anything to the others about that cave. Promise.”</p>
			<p>Hands promised silence; and he and Michael soon discovered a pathway up the cliff. When they reached the garden, it was a deeper green than ever in the falling twilight, and they did not care to linger far from the house. It was a relief to hear voices and to see Rutherford, Hargreaves and Jubb still eating plums. Presently they played games on a lawn with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge, and soon, after reading sleepily for a while in the tumble-down room which was set apart for the boys’ use, Michael and Hands went to bed and, after an exciting encounter with a bat, fell asleep.</p>
			<p>The days in Brittany went by very swiftly. In the morning at eight o’clock there were great bowls of café au lait and rolls with honey and butter waiting in the dining-room for the boys, when they came back from bathing. All the other boys except Michael had come to France to improve their French; but he worked also at the first book of Ovid’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Metamorphoses</i> and at Lucian’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Charon</i>, because he was going in for a scholarship at <abbr>St.</abbr> James’. However, these classical subjects were put away at eleven o’clock, when déjeuner with all sorts of new and delicious dishes was served. After this there was nothing to do until six o’clock but enjoy oneself. Sometimes the boys made expeditions into <abbr>St.</abbr> Corentin, where they wondered at the number of dogs to each inhabitant and bought cakes and sweets at a pastrycook’s and gas-filled balloons which they sent up in the marketplace. Or they would stroll down to the quays and watch the shipping and practise their French on sailors looking more like pirates than ordinary sailors.</p>
			<p>Once, while Michael was gazing into a shop window at some dusty foreign stamps in a brass tray, a Capuchin friar spoke to him in very good English and asked if he collected stamps. Michael said that he did, and the Capuchin invited him to come back to the convent and see his collection. Michael thought this was a splendid invitation and willingly accompanied the Capuchin whom, except for a sore on his lip, he liked very much. He thought the inside of the convent was rather like the inside of an aquarium, but he enjoyed the stamps very much. The friar gave him about a dozen of his duplicates, and Michael promised to write to him, when he got home, and to send him some of his own. Then they had tea in the friar’s cell, and afterwards Michael set out to walk back to <abbr>St.</abbr> Antoine. It was not yet six o’clock when he reached the house, but there was a terrible fuss being made about his adventure. Telegrams had been despatched, the gendarmerie had been informed, and the British Vice-consul had been interviewed. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon asked in his deepest voice where the deuce he had been, and when Michael told him he had been taking tea with a monk, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon was more angry than ever.</p>
			<p>“Don’t do things like that. Good heavens, boy, you might have been kidnapped and turned into a Catholic, before you knew where you were. Hang it all, remember I’m responsible for your safety and never again get into conversation with a wandering monk.”</p>
			<p>Michael explained about the stamps, but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon said that was a very pretty excuse, and would by no means hear of Michael visiting the convent again. When Michael thought over this fuss, he could not understand what it had all been about. He could not imagine anything more harmless than this Capuchin friar with the sore on his lip. However, he never did see him again, except once in the distance, when he pointed him out to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon, who said he looked a dirty ruffian. Michael discovered that grown-up people always saw danger where there was no danger, but when, as on the occasion when Hands and he plainly perceived a ghost in the garden, there was every cause for real alarm, they merely laughed.</p>
			<p>The weather grew warmer as August moved on, and Michael with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge used sometimes to plunge into the depths of the country, there to construe Ovid and Lucian while the other boys worked at French with the Frenchman who came in from <abbr>St.</abbr> Corentin to teach them. Michael enjoyed these expeditions with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge. They would sit down in the lush grass of a shady green lane, close to a pool where the bullfrogs croaked. Michael would construe the tale of Deucalion and Pyrrha to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge, while <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon lay on his back and smoked a large pipe. Then a White Admiral butterfly would soar round the oak trees, and Ovid would be thrown behind them like Deucalion’s stones; while Michael and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge maneuvered and shouted and ran up and down, until the White Admiral was either safely bottled with the cyanide of potassium or soared away out of sight. When Ovid was finished for the day, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge used to light a big pipe and lie on his back, while Michael construed the Dialogue of Charon to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon. Then an Oak Eggar moth would fly with tumbling reckless flight beyond the pool, luring Michael and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon to charge through in pursuit, not deterred by the vivid green slime of the wayside water as the ghosts were deterred by gloomy Styx. Indeed, as the hot August days went by, each one was marked by its butterflies more definitely than by anything else. Michael thought that France was a much better place for collecting them than England. Scarce Swallowtails and Ordinary Swallowtails haunted the cliffs majestically. Clouded Yellows were chased across the fields of clover. Purple Emperors and Camberwell Beauties and Bath Whites were all as frequent as Heath Browns at home. Once, they all went a long expedition to Bluebeard’s Castle on the other side of the Loire, and, while they sat in a garden café, drinking their <i xml:lang="fr">grenadine sucrée</i>, hundreds of Silver-washed Fritillaries appeared over the tables. How the fat French bourgeois stared to see these mad English boys chasing butterflies in their sunny bee-haunted garden. But how lovely the Fritillaries looked, set upside down to show their powdered green and rosy wings washed by silver streaks. Perhaps the most exciting catch of all happened, close to the shutting in of a September dusk, in the avenue of pollarded acacias. Michael saw the moth first on the lowest bough of a tree. It was jet-black marked with thick creamy stripes. Neither he nor Hands had a net, and they trembled with excitement and chagrin. Michael threw a stone rather ineffectively and the moth changed its position, showing before it settled down on a higher branch underwings of glowing vermilion.</p>
			<p>“Oh, what can it be?” Michael cried, dancing.</p>
			<p>“It’s frightfully rare,” squeaked Hands.</p>
			<p>“You watch it carefully, while I scoot for a net,” commanded Michael.</p>
			<p>He tore along up the darkening drive, careless of ghosts or travelling seamen bent on murder and robbery. He rushed into the hall and shouted, “A terribly rare moth in the drive! Quick, my net!” and rushed back to the vigilant Hands. The others followed, and after every cunning of the hunter had been tried, the moth was at last secured and after a search through Kirby’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Butterflies and Moths</i> pronounced to be a Jersey Tiger, not so rare, after all, in fact very common abroad. But it was a glorious beast when set, richly black, barred and striped with damasked cream over a flame of orange-scarlet.</p>
			<p>The six weeks were over. Michael had to leave in advance of the others, in order to enter for his scholarship examination at <abbr>St.</abbr> James’. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge took him to <abbr>St.</abbr> Malo and handed him over to the charge of Rutherford’s older brother, who was already at <abbr>St.</abbr> James’ and would see Michael safely to London. Michael could scarcely believe that this Rutherford was a boy, so tall was he, such a heavy black moustache had he and so pleasant was he to Michael. Michael thought with regret of the green and golden days in Brittany, as he waved to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge standing on the <abbr>St.</abbr> Malo jetty. He felt, as the steamer sailed across the glassy sea through a thick September haze, that he was coming back to greater adventures, that he was older and, as he paced beside Rutherford up and down the deck, that he was more important. But he thought with regret of Brittany and squeaky Hands and the warm days of butterflies. He hoped to return next year and see again the fig tree by his bedroom window and the level shore of the Loire estuary and the tangled tumble-down garden on the cliff’s edge. He would always think of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lodge and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vernon, those very dearly loved schoolmasters. He would think of the ghostly Breton lanes at twilight and the glorious Sundays unspoilt by church or best clothes and of the bullfrogs in the emerald pools.</p>
			<p>Michael disliked the examination very much indeed. He hated the way in which all the other competitors stared. He disliked the speed with which they wrote and the easy manners of some of them. However, he gained his scholarship mostly by age marks and was put in the Lower Third, the youngest boy in the class by two years, and became a Jacobean, turning every morning round the same gate, walking every morning up the same gravel path, running every morning up the same wide steps, meeting every morning the same smell of hot-water pipes and hearing every day the same shuffle of quick feet along the corridors past the same plaster cast of the <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.sculpture">Laocoön</i>.</p>
