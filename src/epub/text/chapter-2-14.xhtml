			<p>In the air of the Easter holidays that year there must have been something unusually amorous even for April, for when Michael came back to school he found that most of his friends and contemporaries had been wounded by love’s darts. Alan, to be sure, returned unscathed, but as he had been resting in the comparatively cloistral seclusion of Cobble Place, Michael did not count his whole heart much honour to anything except his lack of opportunity. Everybody else had come back in possession of girls; some even had acquired photographs. There was talk of gloves and handkerchiefs, of flowers and fans, but nobody, as far as Michael could cautiously ascertain, had thought of soap; and he congratulated himself upon his relic. Also, apparently, all his friends in their pursuit of Eastertide nymphs had been successful, and he began to take credit to himself for being unlucky. His refusal (to this already had come Kathleen’s suddenly withdrawn hand) gave him a peculiar interest, and those of his friends in whom he confided looked at him with awe, and listened respectfully to his legend of despair.</p>
			<p>Beneath the hawthorns on the golden afternoons and lingering topaz eves of May, Michael would wait for Alan to finish his game of cricket, and between lazily applauded strokes and catches he would tell the tale of Kathleen to his fellows:</p>
			<p>“I asked her to wait for me. Of course she was older than me. I said I was ready to marry her when I was twenty-one, but there was another chap, a decent fellow, devilish handsome, too. He was frightfully rich, and so she agreed to elope with him. I helped them no end. I told her father he simply must not attempt to interfere. But, of course, I was frightfully cut up⁠—oh, absolutely knocked out. We’re all of us unlucky in love in our family. My sister was in love with an Austrian who was killed by an avalanche. I don’t suppose I shall ever be in love again. They say you never really fall in love more than once in your life. I feel a good deal older this term. I suppose I look⁠ ⁠… oh, well hit indeed⁠—run it out, and again, sir, and again⁠ ⁠… !”</p>
			<p>So Michael would break off the tale of his love, until one of his listeners would seek to learn more of passion’s frets and fevers.</p>
			<p>“But, Bangs, what about the day she eloped? What did you do?”</p>
			<p>“I wrote poetry,” Michael would answer.</p>
			<p>“Great Scott, that’s a bit of a swat, isn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, it’s a bit difficult,” Michael would agree. “Only, of course, I only write <i xml:lang="la">vers libre</i>. No rhymes or anything.”</p>
			<p>And then an argument would arise as to whether poetry without rhymes could fairly be called poetry at all. This argument, or another like it, would last until the cricket stopped, when Michael and his fellows would stroll into the pavilion and examine the scoring-book or criticize the conduct of the game.</p>
			<p>It was a pleasant time, that summer term, and life moved on very equably for Michael, notwithstanding his Eastertide heartbreak. Alan caused him a little trouble by his indifference to anything but cricket, and one Sunday, when May had deepened into June, Michael took him to task for his attitude. Alan had asked Michael over to Richmond for the weekend, and the two of them had punted down the river towards Kew. They had moored their boat under a weeping willow about the time when the bells for church, begin to chime across the level water-meadows.</p>
			<p>“Alan, aren’t you ever going to fall in love?” Michael began.</p>
			<p>“Why should I?” Alan countered in his usual way.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know. I think it’s time you did,” said Michael. “You’ve no idea how much older it makes you feel. And I suppose you don’t want to remain a kid forever. Because, you know, old chap, you are an awful kid beside me.”</p>
			<p>“Thanks very much,” said Alan. “I believe you’re exactly one month older, as a matter of fact.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, in actual time,” said Michael earnestly. “But in experience I’m years older than you.”</p>
			<p>“That must be why you’re such a rotten field,” commented Alan. “After forty the joints get stiff.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, chuck being funny,” said Michael severely. “I’m in earnest. Now you know as well as I do that last term and the term before I was miserable. Well, look at me now. I’m absolutely happy.”</p>
			<p>“I thought you were so frightfully depressed,” said Alan, twinkling. “I thought you’d had an unlucky love affair. It seems to take you differently from the way it takes most people.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, of course, I <em>was</em> miserable,” Michael explained. “But now I’m happy in her happiness. That’s love.”</p>
			<p>Alan burst out laughing, and Michael observed that if he intended to receive his confidences in such a flippant way, he would in future take care to be more secretive.</p>
			<p>“I’m showing you what a lot I care about you,” Michael went on in tones of deepest injury, “by telling you about myself. I think it’s rather rotten of you to laugh.”</p>
			<p>“But you’ve told everybody,” Alan pointed out.</p>
			<p>Michael took another tack, and explained to Alan that he wanted the spur of his companionship in everything.</p>
			<p>“It would be so ripping if we were both in love,” he sighed. “Honestly, Alan, don’t you feel I’m much more developed since last term? I say, you played awfully well yesterday against Dulford Second. If you go on improving at the rate you are now, I don’t see why you shouldn’t get your Blue at Oxford. By Jove, you know, in eighteen months we shall be at Oxford. Are you keen?”</p>
			<p>“Frightfully keen,” said Alan. “Especially if I haven’t got to be in love all the time.”</p>
			<p>“I’m not going to argue with you any more,” Michael announced. “But you’re making a jolly big mistake. Still, of course, I do understand about your cricket, and I dare say love might make you a bit boss-eyed. Perhaps when footer begins again next term, I shall get over this perpetual longing I have for Kathleen. You’ve no idea how awful I felt when she said she loved Trimble. He was rather a bounder too, but of course I had to help them. I say, Alan, do you remember Dora and Winnie?”</p>
			<p>“Rather,” said Alan, smiling. “We made pretty good asses of ourselves over them. Do you remember how fed up Nancy got?”</p>
			<p>So, very easily the conversation drifted into reminiscences of earlier days, until the sky was quilted with rose-tipped pearly clouds. Then they swung a Japanese lantern in the prow and worked upstream towards Richmond clustering dark against the west, while an ivory moon shimmered on the dying azure of the day behind.</p>
			<p>Throughout June the image of Kathleen became gradually fainter and fainter with each materialization that Michael evoked. Then one evening before dinner he found that the maid had forgotten to put a fresh cake of soap in the dish. It was a question of ringing the bell or of callously using Kathleen’s commemorative tablet. Michael went to his drawer and, as he slowly washed his hands, he washed from his mind the few insignificant outlines of Kathleen that were printed there. The soap was Trèfle Incarnat, and somewhat cynically Michael relished the savour of it, and even made up his mind to buy a full fat cake when this one should be finished. Kathleen, however, even in the fragrant moment of her annihilation, had her revenge, for Michael experienced a return of the old restlessness and discontent that was not mitigated by Alan’s increasing preoccupation with cricket. He did not complain of this, for he respected the quest of School Colours, and was proud for Alan. At the same time something must be done to while away these warm summer evenings until at Basingstead Minor, where his mother had delightfully agreed to take a cottage for the summer, he and Alan could revive old days at Cobble Place.</p>
			<p>One evening Michael went out about nine o’clock to post a letter and, finding the evening velvety and calm, strolled on through the enticing streets of twilight. The violet shadows in which the white caps and aprons of gossiping maids took on a moth-like immaterial beauty, the gliding, enraptured lovers, the scent of freshly watered flower-boxes, the stars winking between the chimney-pots, and all the drowsy alertness of a fine London dusk drew him on to turn each new corner as it arrived, until he saw the sky stained with dull gold from the reflection of the lively crater of the Earl’s Court Exhibition, and heard over the vague intervening noises music that was sometimes clearly melodious, sometimes a mere confusion of spasmodic sound.</p>
			<p>Michael suddenly thought he would like to spend his evening at the Exhibition, and wondered to himself why he had never thought of going there casually like this, why always he had considered it necessary to devote a hot afternoon and flurried evening to its exploitation. By the entrance he met a fellow-Jacobean, one Drake, whose accentuated mannishness, however disagreeable in the proximity of the school, might be valuable at the Exhibition. Michael therefore accepted his boisterous greeting pleasantly enough, and they passed through the turnstiles together.</p>
			<p>“I’ll introduce you to a smart girl, if you like,” Drake offered, as they paused undecided between the attractions of two portions of the Exhibition. “She sells Turkish Delight by the Cave of the Four Winds. Very <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.T.</abbr>, my boy,” Drake went on.</p>
			<p>“Do you mean⁠—” Michael began.</p>
			<p>“What? Rather,” said Drake. “I’ve been home to her place.”</p>
			<p>“No joking?” Michael asked.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” affirmed Drake with a triumphant inhalation of sibilant breath.</p>
			<p>“Rather lucky, wasn’t it?” Michael asked. “I mean to say, it was rather lucky to meet her.”</p>
			<p>“She might take you home,” suggested Drake, examining Michael critically.</p>
			<p>“But I mightn’t like her,” Michael expostulated.</p>
			<p>“Good Lord,” exclaimed Drake, struck by a point of view that was obviously dismaying in its novelty, “you don’t mean to say you’d bother about that, if you could?”</p>
			<p>“Well, I rather think I should,” Michael admitted. “I think I’d want to be in love.”</p>
			<p>“You are an extraordinary chap,” said Drake. “Now if I were dead nuts on a girl, the last thing I’d think of would be that.”</p>
			<p>They walked along silently, each one pondering the other’s incomprehensibleness, until they came to the stall presided over by Miss Mabel Bannerman, who in Michael’s opinion bore a curious resemblance to the Turkish Delight she sold. With the knowledge of her he had obtained from Drake, Michael regarded Miss Bannerman very much as he would have looked at an animal in the Zoological Gardens with whose habits he had formed a previous acquaintanceship through a book of natural history. He tried to perceive beyond her sachet-like hands and watery blue eyes and spongy hair and full-blown breast the fascination which had made her man’s common property. Then he looked at Drake, and came to the conclusion that the problem was not worth the difficulty of solution.</p>
			<p>“I think I’ll be getting back,” said Michael awkwardly.</p>
			<p>“Why, it’s not ten,” gasped Drake. “Don’t be an ass. Mabel gets out at eleven, and we can take her home. Can’t we, Mabel?”</p>
			<p>“Sauce!” Mabel archly snapped.</p>
			<p>This savoury monosyllable disposed of Michael’s hesitation, and, as the personality of Mabel cloyed him with a sudden nausea like her own Turkish Delight, he left her to Drake without another word and went home to bed.</p>
			<p>The night was hot and drew Michael from vain attempts at sleep to the open window where, as he sat thinking, a strange visionary survey of the evening, a survey that he himself could scarcely account for, was conjured up. He had not been aware at the time of much more than Drake and the Turkish Delight stall. Now he realized that he too craved for a Mabel, not a peony of a woman who could be flaunted like a vulgar buttonhole, but a more shy, a more subtle creature, yet conquerable. Then, as Michael stared out over the housetops at the brooding pavilion of sky which enclosed the hectic city, he began to recall the numberless glances, the countless attitudes, all the sensuous phantasmagoria of the Exhibition’s population. He remembered a slim hand, a slanting eye, lips translucent in a burst of light. He caught at scents that, always fugitive, were now utterly incommunicable; he trembled at the remembrance of some contact in a crowd that had been at once divinely intimate and unendurably remote. The illusion of all the city’s sleepers calling to him became more and more vivid under each stifling breath of the night. Somewhere beneath that sable diadem of chimney-tops she lay, that lovely girl of his desire. He would not picture her too clearly lest he should destroy the charm of this amazing omnipotence of longing. He would be content to enfold the imagination of her, and at dawn let her slip from his arms like a cloud. He would sit all the night time at his window, aware of kisses. Was this the emotion that prompted poets to their verses? Michael broke his trance to search for paper and pencil, and wrote ecstatically.</p>
			<p>In the morning, when he read what he had written, he hastily tore it up, and made up his mind that the Earl’s Court Exhibition would feed his fire more satisfactorily than bad verses. Half a guinea would buy a season-ticket, and July should be a pageant of sensations.</p>
			<p>Every night Michael went to Earl’s Court, and here a hundred brilliant but evanescent flames were kindled in his heart, just as in the Exhibition gardens every night for three hours the fairy-lamps spangled the edge of the paths in threads of many-tinted lights. Michael always went alone, because he did not desire any but his own discoveries to reward his excited speculation. At first he merely enjoyed the sensation of the slow stream of people that continually went up and down, or strolled backwards and forwards, or circled round the bandstand that was set out like a great gaudy coronet upon the parterres of lobelias and geraniums and calceolarias that with nightfall came to seem brocaded cushions.</p>
			<p>It was a time profitable with a thousand reflections, this crowded hour of the promenade. There was always the mesmeric sighing of silk skirts and the ceaseless murmur of conversation; there was the noise of the band and the tapping of canes; there was, in fact, a regularity of sound that was as infinitely soothing as breaking waves or a wind-ruffled wood. There were the sudden provocative glances which flashed as impersonally as precious stones, and yet lanced forth a thrill that no faceted gem could give. There were hands whose white knuckles, as they rippled over Michael’s hands in some momentary pressure of the throng, gave him a sense of being an instrument upon which a chord had been clearly struck. There were strands of hair that floated against his cheeks with a strange, but exquisitely elusive intimacy of communication. It was all very intoxicating and very sensuous; but the spell crept over him as imperceptibly as if he were merely yielding himself to the influence of a beautiful landscape, as if he were lotus-eating in a solitude created by numbers.</p>
			<p>Michael, however, was not content to dream away in a crowd these passionate nights of July; and after a while he set out to find adventures in the great bazaar of the Exhibition, wandering through the golden corridors and arcades with a queer sense of suppressed expectancy. So many fantastic trades were carried on here, that it was natural to endow the girls behind the counters with a more romantic life than that of ordinary and anæmic shop-assistants. Even Miss Mabel Bannerman amid her Turkish Delight came to seem less crude in such surroundings, and Michael once or twice had thoughts of prosecuting his acquaintanceship; for as yet he had not been able to bring himself to converse with any of the numerous girls, so much more attractive than Mabel, who were haunting him with their suggestion of a strange potentiality.</p>
			<p>Michael wandered on past the palmists who went in and out of their tapestried tents; past the physiognomists and phrenologists and graphologists; past the vendors of scents and silver; past the languid women who spread out their golden rugs from Samarkand; past the Oriental shops fuming with odorous pastilles, where lamps encrusted in deep-hued jewels of glass glimmered richly; past that slant-eyed cigarette-seller with the crimson fez crowning her dark hair.</p>
			<p>July was nearing its end; the holidays were in sight; and still Michael had got no farther with his ambitions; still at the last moment he would pass on and neglect some perfect opportunity for speech. He used to rail at his cowardice, and repeat to himself all his academic knowledge of frail womanhood. He even took the trouble to consult the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ars Amatoria</i>, and was so much impressed by Ovid’s prescription for behaviour at a circus that he determined to follow his advice. To put his theory into practice, Michael selected a booth where seals performed for humanity at sixpence a head. But all his resolutions ended in sitting mildly amused by the entertainment in a condition of absolute decorum.</p>
			<p>School broke up with the usual explosion of self-congratulatory rhetoric from which Michael, owing to his Exhibition ticket, failed to emerge with any calf-bound souvenir of intellectual achievement. He minded this less than his own pusillanimous behaviour on the brink of experience. It made him desperate to think that in two days he would be at Basingstead with his mother and Alan and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross, utterly remote even from the pretence of temptation.</p>
			<p>“Dearest Michael, you really must get your things together,” expostulated <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane, when he announced his intention of going round to the Exhibition as usual on the night before they were to leave town.</p>
			<p>“Well, mother, I can pack when I come in, and I do want to get all I can out of this ‘season.’ You see it will be absolutely wasted for August and half September.”</p>
			<p>“Michael,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane suddenly, “you’re not keeping anything from me?”</p>
			<p>“Good gracious, no. What makes you ask?” Michael demanded, blushing.</p>
			<p>“I was afraid that perhaps some horrid girl might have got hold of you,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane.</p>
			<p>“Why, would you mind very much?” asked Michael, with a curious hopefulness that his mother would pursue the subject, as if by so doing she would give him an opportunity of regarding himself and his behaviour objectively.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know that I should mind very much,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane, “if I thought you were quite certain not to do anything foolish.” Then she seemed to correct the laxity of her point of view, and substituted, “anything that you might regret.”</p>
			<p>“What could I regret?” asked Michael, seeking to drive his mother on to the rocks of frankness.</p>
			<p>“Surely you know what better than I can tell you. Don’t you?” The note of interrogation caught the wind, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane sailed off on the starboard tack.</p>
			<p>“But as long as you’re not keeping anything from me,” she went on, “I don’t mind. So go out, dear child, and enjoy yourself by all means. But don’t be very late.”</p>
			<p>“I never am,” said Michael quickly, and a little resentfully as he thought of his very decorous homecomings.</p>
			<p>“I know you’re not. You’re really a very dear fellow,” his mother murmured, now safe in port.</p>
			<p>So at nine o’clock as usual Michael passed through the turnstiles and began his feverish progress across the Exhibition grounds, trying as he had never tried before to screw himself up to the pitch of the experience he craved.</p>
			<p>He was standing by one of the entrances to the Court of Marvels, struggling with his self-consciousness and egging himself on to be bold on this his last night, when he heard himself accosted as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Michael Fane. He looked round and saw a man whom he instantly recognized, but for the moment could not name.</p>
			<p>“It is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Michael Fane?” the stranger asked. “You don’t remember me? I met you at Clere Abbey.”</p>
			<p>“Brother Aloysius!” Michael exclaimed, and as he uttered the high-sounding religious appellation he almost laughed at the incongruity of it in connection with this slightly overdressed and dissolute-looking person he so entitled.</p>
			<p>“Well, not exactly, old chap. At least not in this getup. Meats is my name.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes,” said Michael vaguely. There seemed no other comment on such a name, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Meats himself appeared sensitive to the implication of uncertainty, for he made haste to put Michael at ease by commenting on its oddity.</p>
			<p>“I suppose you’re thinking it’s a damned funny exchange for Brother Aloysius. But a fellow can’t help his name, and that’s a fact.”</p>
			<p>“You’ve left the Abbey then?” enquired Michael.</p>
			<p>“Oh Lord, yes. Soon after you went. It was no place for me. Manners, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.S.B.</abbr>, gave me the push pretty quick. And I don’t blame him. Well, what are you doing? Have a drink? Or have you got to meet your best girl? My, you’ve grown since I saw you last. Quite the Johnny nowadays. But I spotted you all right. Something about your eyes that would be very hard to forget.”</p>
			<p>Michael thought that if it came to unforgettable eyes, the eyes of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Meats would stand as much chance of perpetual remembrance as any, since their unholy light would surely set any heart beating with the breathless imagination of sheer wickedness.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I have got funny eyes, haven’t I?” said Meats in complacent realization of Michael’s thoughts. And as he spoke he seemed consciously to exercise their vile charm, so that his irises kindled slowly with lambent blue flames.</p>
			<p>“Come on, let’s have this drink,” urged Meats, and he led the way to a scattered group of green tables. They sat down, and Michael ordered a lemon-squash.</p>
			<p>“Very good drink too,” commented Meats. “I think I’ll have the same, Rosie,” he said to the girl who served them.</p>
			<p>“Do you know that girl?” Michael asked.</p>
			<p>“Used to. About three years ago. She’s gone oil though,” said Meats indifferently.</p>
			<p>Michael, to hide his astonishment at the contemptuous suggestion of damaged goods, enquired what Meats had been doing since he left the Monastery.</p>
			<p>“Want to know?” asked Meats.</p>
			<p>Michael assured him that he did.</p>
			<p>“You’re rather interested in me, aren’t you? Well, I can tell you a few things and that’s a fact. I don’t suppose that there’s anybody in London who could tell you more. But you might be shocked.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, shut up!” scoffed Michael, blushing with indignation.</p>
			<p>Then began the shameless narration of the late Brother Aloysius, whom various attainments had enabled to gain an equal profit from religion and vice. Sometimes as Michael listened to the adventures he was reminded of Benvenuto Cellini or Casanova, but almost immediately the comparison would be shattered by a sudden sanctimonious blasphemy which he found nauseating. Moreover, he disliked the sly procurer that continually leered through the man’s personality.</p>
			<p>“You seem to have done a lot of dirty work for other people,” Michael bluntly observed at last.</p>
			<p>“My dear old chap,” replied Meats, “of course I have. You see, in this world there are lots of people who can always square their own consciences, if the worst of what they want to do is done for them behind the scenes as it were. You never yet heard a man confess that he ruined a girl. Now, did you? Why, I’ve heard the most shocking out-and-outers anyone could wish to meet brag that they’ve done everything, and then turn up their eyes and thank God they’ve always respected real purity. Well, I never respected anything or anybody. And why should I? I never had a chance. Who was my mother? A servant. Who was my father? A minister, a Nonconformist minister in Wales. And what did the old tyke do? Why, he took the case to court and swore my mother was out for blackmail. So she went to prison, and he came smirking home behind the village band; and all the old women in the place hung out Union Jacks to show they believed in him. And then his wife gave a party.”</p>
			<p>Michael looked horrified and felt horrified at this revelation of vileness, and yet, all the time he was listening, through some grotesquery of his nerves he was aware of thinking to himself the jingle of Little Bo-peep.</p>
			<p>“Ah, that’s touched you up, hasn’t it?” said Meats, eagerly leaning forward. “But wait a bit. What did my mother do when she came out? Went on the streets. Do you hear? On the streets, and mark you, she was a servant, a common village servant, none of your flash Empire goods. Oh, no, she never knew what it was like to go up the river on a Sunday afternoon. And she drank. Well, of course she drank. Gin was as near as she ever got to paradise. And where was I brought up? Not among the buttercups, my friend, you may lay on that. No, I was down underneath, underneath, underneath where a chap like you will never go because you’re a gentleman. And so, though, of course, you’re never likely to ruin a girl, you’ll always have your fun. Why shouldn’t you? Being a nicely brought-up young gentleman, it’s your birthright.”</p>
			<p>“But how on earth did you ever become a monk?” asked Michael, anxious to divert the conversation away from himself.</p>
			<p>“Well, it does sound a bit improbable, I must say. I was recommended there by a priest⁠—a nice chap called Arbuthnot who’d believe a chimney-sweep was a miller. But Manners was very sharp on to me, and I was very sharp on to Manners. Picking blackberries and emptying slops! What a game! I came with a character and left without one. Probationer was what they called me. Silly mug was what I called myself.”</p>
			<p>“You seem to know a lot of priests,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“Oh, I’ve been in with parsons since I was at Sunday-school. Well, don’t look so surprised. You don’t suppose my mother wanted me hanging round all the afternoon! Now I very soon found out that one can always get round a High Church slum parson, and very often a Catholic priest by turning over a new leaf and confessing. It gets them every time, and being by nature generous, it gets their pockets. That’s why I gave up Dissenters and fashionable Vicars. Dissenters want more than they give, and fashionable Vicars are too clever. That’s why they become fashionable Vicars, I suppose,” said Meats pensively.</p>
			<p>“But you couldn’t go on taking in even priests forever,” Michael objected.</p>
			<p>“Ah, now I’ll tell you something. I do feel religious sometimes,” Meats declared solemnly. “And I do really want to lead a new life. But it doesn’t last. It’s like love. Never mind, perhaps I’ll be lucky enough to die when I’m working off a religious stretch. I give you my word, Fane, that often in these fits I’ve felt like committing suicide just to cheat the devil. Would you believe that?”</p>
			<p>“I don’t think you’re as bad as you make out,” said Michael sententiously.</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, I am,” smiled the other. “I’m rotten bad. But I reckon the first man I meet in hell will be my father, and if it’s possible to hurt anyone down there more than they’re being hurt already, I’ll do it. But look here, I shall get the hump with this blooming conversation you’ve started me off on. Come along, drink up and have another, and tell us something about yourself.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, there’s nothing to tell,” Michael sighed. “My existence is pretty dull after yours.”</p>
			<p>“I suppose it is,” said Meats, as if struck by a new thought. “Everything has its compensations, as they say.”</p>
			<p>“Frightfully dull,” Michael vowed. “Why, here am I still at school! You know I wouldn’t half mind going down underneath, as you call it, for a while. I believe I’d like it.”</p>
			<p>“If you knew you could get up again all right,” commented Meats.</p>
			<p>“Oh, of course,” Michael answered. “I don’t suppose Aeneas would have cared much about going down to hell, if he hadn’t been sure he could come up again quite safely.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I don’t know your friend with the Jewish name,” said Meats. “But I’ll lay he didn’t come out much wiser than he went in if he knew he could get out all right by pressing a button and taking the first lift up.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, well, I was only speaking figuratively,” Michael explained.</p>
			<p>“So was I. The same here, and many of them, old chap,” retorted Meats enigmatically.</p>
			<p>“Ah, you don’t think I’m in earnest. You think I’m fooling,” Michael complained.</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, I think you’d like to take a peep without letting go of Nurse’s apron,” sneered Meats.</p>
			<p>“Well, perhaps one day you’ll see me underneath,” Michael almost threatened.</p>
			<p>“No offence, old chap,” said Meats cordially. “It’s no good my giving you an address because it won’t last, but London isn’t very big, and we’ll run up against one another again, that’s a cert. Now I’ve got to toddle off and meet a girl.”</p>
			<p>“Have you?” asked Michael, and his enquiry was tinged with a faint longing that the other noticed at once.</p>
			<p>“Jealous?” enquired Meats. “Why, look at all the girls round about you. It’s up to you not to feel lonely.”</p>
			<p>“I know,” said Michael fretfully. “But how the deuce can I tell whether they want me to talk to them?”</p>
			<p>Meats laughed shrilly.</p>
			<p>“What are you afraid of? Leading some innocent lamb astray?”</p>
			<p>Again to Michael occurred the ridiculous rhyme of Bo-peep. So insistent was it that he could scarcely refrain from humming it aloud.</p>
			<p>“Of course I’m not afraid of that,” he protested. “But how am I to tell they won’t think me a brute?”</p>
			<p>“What would it matter if they did?” asked Meats.</p>
			<p>“Well, I should feel a fool.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, dear. You’re very young, aren’t you?”</p>
			<p>“It’s nothing to do with being young,” Michael asserted. “I simply don’t want to be a cad.”</p>
			<p>“Somebody else is to be the cad first and then it’s all right, eh?” chuckled Meats. “But it’s a shame to tease a nice chap like you. I dare say Daisy’ll have a friend with her.”</p>
			<p>“Is Daisy the girl you’re going to see?”</p>
			<p>“You’ve guessed my secret,” said Meats. “Come on, I’ll introduce you.”</p>
			<p>As Michael rose to follow Meats, he felt that he was like Faust with Mephistopheles. But Faust had asked for his youth back again. Michael only demanded the courage not to waste youth while it was his to enjoy. He felt that his situation was essentially different from the other, and he hesitated no longer.</p>
			<p>The next half-hour passed in a whirl. Michael was conscious of a slim brunette in black and scarlet, and of a fairy-like figure by her side in a dress of shimmering blue; he was conscious too of a voice insinuating, softly metallic, and of fingers that touched his wrist as lightly as silk. There were whispers and laughters and sudden sweeping embarrassments. There was a horrible sense of publicity, of curious mocking eyes that watched his progress. There was an overwhelming knowledge of money burning in his pocket, of money hard and round and powerful. There were hot waves of remorse and the thought of his heart hammering him on to be brave. A cabman leaned over from his box like a gargoyle. A key clicked.</p>
			<p>Then, it seemed a century afterwards, Carlington Road stretched dim, austere, forbidding to Michael’s ingress. A policeman’s deep salutation sounded portentously reproachful. The bloom of dawn was on the windows. The flames in the streetlamps were pale as primroses. At his own house Michael saw the red and amber sparrows in their crude blue vegetation horribly garish against the lighted entrance-hall. The Salve printed funereally upon the mat was the utterance of blackest irony. He hastily turned down the gas, and the stairs caught a chill unreality from the creeping dawn. The balustrade stuck to his parched hands; the stairs creaked grotesquely to his breathless ascent. His mother stood like a ghost in her doorway.</p>
			<p>“Michael, how dreadfully late you are.”</p>
			<p>“Am I?” said Michael. “I suppose it is rather late. I met a fellow I know.”</p>
			<p>He spoke petulantly to conceal his agitation, and his one thought was to avoid kissing her before he went up to his own room.</p>
			<p>“It’s all right about my packing,” he murmured hastily. “In the morning I shall have time. I’m sorry I woke you. Good night.”</p>
			<p>He had passed; and he looked back compassionately, as she faded in her rosy and indefinite loveliness away to her room.</p>
			<p>Then, with the patterns of foulard ties crawling like insects before his strained eyes, with collars coiling and uncoiling like mainsprings, with all his clothes in one large intolerable muddle, Michael pressed the cold sheets to his forehead and tried to imagine that tomorrow he would be in the country.</p>
