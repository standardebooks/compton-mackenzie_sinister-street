			<p>Dinner with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Arthur Wilmot occupied most of Michael’s thoughts for a week. He was mainly concerned about his costume, and he was strenuously importunate for a tailcoat. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane, however, was sure that a dinner-jacket would better become his youthfulness. Then arose the question of stickup collars. Michael pointed out that very soon he would be sixteen, and that here was a fine opportunity to leave behind the Polo or Shakespeare collar.</p>
			<p>“You’re growing up so quickly, dearest boy,” sighed his mother.</p>
			<p>Michael was anxious to have one of the new double collars.</p>
			<p>“But don’t they look rather outré?” protested <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane.</p>
			<p>“Well, Abercrombie, the Secretary of the Fifteen, wears one,” observed Michael.</p>
			<p>“Have your own way, dear,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane gently.</p>
			<p>Two or three days before the dinner-party Michael braved everything and wore one of the new double collars to school. Its extravagant advent among the discreet neckwear of the Upper Fifth caused a sensation. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cray himself looked curiously once or twice at Michael, who assumed in consequence a particularly nonchalant air, and lounged over his desk even more than usual.</p>
			<p>“Are you going on the stage, Fane?” enquired <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cray finally, exasperated by Michael’s indolent construing.</p>
			<p>“Not that I know of,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“I wasn’t sure whether that collar was part of your getup as an eccentric comedian.”</p>
			<p>The Upper Fifth released its well-worn laugh, and Michael scowled at his master.</p>
			<p>However, he endured the sarcasm of the first two days and still wore the new collars, vowing to himself that presently he would make fresh attacks upon the convention of school attire, since apparently he was able thereby to irritate old Cray.</p>
			<p>After all, the dinner-party was not so exciting as he had hoped from the sample of his new friend’s conversation. To be sure he was able to smoke as much as he liked, and drink as much champagne as he knew how without warning headshakes; but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnstone, the Member for West Kensington, was a moon-faced bore, and his nephew turned out to be a lank nonentity on the despised Modern side. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Johnstone talked a good deal about the Catholic movement, which somehow during the last few weeks was ceasing to interest Michael so much as formerly. Michael himself ascribed this apostasy to his perusal, ladder-high, of Zola’s novel <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lourdes</i> with its damaging assaults upon Christian credulity. The Member of Parliament seemed to Michael, after his psychical adventures of the past few months, curiously dull and antique, and he evidently considered Michael affected. However, he encouraged the idea of ecclesiastical law, and promised to talk to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Brownjohn about Michael’s release from the thraldom of Classics. As for the nephew, he seemed to be able to do nothing but stretch the muscles of his chicken-like neck and ask continually whether Michael was going to join the Field Club that some obscure Modern Lower Master was in travail with at the moment. He also invited Michael to join a bicycling club that apparently met at Surbiton every other Saturday afternoon. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot contented himself with silence and the care of his guests’ entertainment.</p>
			<p>Finally the Member for West Kensington with his crudely jointed nephew departed into the fog, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot, with an exaggerated sigh, shut the front door.</p>
			<p>“I must be going too,” said Michael grudgingly.</p>
			<p>“My dear boy, the evening has scarcely begun,” objected <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot. “Come upstairs to my library, and tell me all about your opinions, and whether you do not think that everything is an affectation.”</p>
			<p>They went up together.</p>
			<p>“Every year I redecorate this room,” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot explained. “Last year it was apple-green set out with cherry-red. Now I am become a mysterious peacock-blue, for lately I have felt terribly old. How well this uncertain tint suits your fresh languor.”</p>
			<p>Michael admired the dusky blue chamber with the plain mirrors of tarnished gilt, the gleaming books and exotic engravings, and the heterogeneous finery faintly effeminate. He buried himself in a deep embroidered chair, with an ebony box of cigarettes at his feet, while <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot, after a myriad mincing preliminaries, sought out various highly coloured bottles of liqueurs.</p>
			<p>“This is a jolly ripping room,” sighed Michael.</p>
			<p>“It represents a year’s moods,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot.</p>
			<p>“And then will you change it?” asked Michael.</p>
			<p>“Perhaps. The most subtly painted serpent casts ultimately its slough. Crème-de-Menthe?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, please,” said Michael, who would have accepted anything in his present receptive condition.</p>
			<p>“And what do you think of life?” enquired <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot, taking his place on a divan opposite Michael. “Do you mind if I smoke my Jicky-scented hookah?” he added.</p>
			<p>“Not at all,” said Michael. “These cigarettes are jolly ripping. I think life at school is frightfully dull⁠—except, of course, when one goes out. Only I don’t often.”</p>
			<p>“Dull?” repeated <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot. “Listen to the amazing cruelty of youth, that finds even his adventurous Sicilian existence dull.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it is,” said Michael. “I think I used to like it, but nowadays everything gets fearfully stale almost at once.”</p>
			<p>“Already your life has been lived?” queried <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot very anxiously.</p>
			<p>“Well, not exactly,” Michael replied, with a quick glance towards his host to make sure he was not joking. “I expect that when I leave school I shall get interested again. Only just lately I’ve given up everything. First I was keen on Footer, and then I got keen on Ragging, and then I got keen on Work even (this was confessed apologetically), and just lately I’ve been keen on the Church⁠—only now I find that’s pretty stale.”</p>
			<p>“The Church!” echoed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot. “How wonderful! The dim Gothic glooms, the sombre hues of stained glass, the incense-wreathèd acolytes, the muttering priests, the bedizened banners and altars and images. Ah, elusive and particoloured vision that once was mine!”</p>
			<p>“Then I got keen on Swinburne,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“You advance along the well-worn path of the Interior and Elect,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot.</p>
			<p>“I’m still keen on Swinburne, but he makes me feel hopeless. Sad and hopeless,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“Under the weight of sin?” asked <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot.</p>
			<p>“Not exactly⁠—because he seems to have done everything and⁠—”</p>
			<p>“You’d like to?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I would,” said Michael. “Only one can’t live like a Roman Emperor at a public school. What I hate is the way everybody thinks you ought to be interested in things that aren’t really interesting at all. What people can’t understand about me is that I <em>could</em> be keener than anybody about things schoolmasters and that kind don’t think right or at any rate important. I don’t mean to say I want to be dissipated, but⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Dissipated?” echoed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot, raising his eyebrows.</p>
			<p>“Well, you know what I mean,” blushed Michael.</p>
			<p>“Dissipation is a condition of extreme old age. I might be dissipated, not you,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot. “Why not say wanton? How much more beautiful, how much more intense a word.”</p>
			<p>“But wanton sounds so beastly affected,” said Michael. “As if it was taken out of the Bible. And you aren’t so very old. Not more than thirty.”</p>
			<p>“I think what you’re trying to say is that, under your present mode of life, you find self-expression impossible. Let me diagnose your symptoms.”</p>
			<p>Michael leaned forward eagerly at this proposal. Nothing was so entertaining to his egoism just now as diagnosis. Moreover, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot seemed inclined to take him more seriously than <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Viner, or, indeed, any of his spiritual directors so far. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot prepared himself for the lecture by lighting a very long cigarette wrapped in brittle fawn-coloured paper, whose spirals of smoke Michael followed upward to their ultimate evanescence, as if indeed they typified with their tenuous plumes and convolutions the intricate discourse that begot them.</p>
			<p>“In a sense, my dear boy, your charm has waned⁠—the faerie charm, that is, which wraps in heedless silver armour the perfect boyhood of man. You are at present a queer sort of mythical animal whom we for want of a better term call ‘adolescent.’ Intercourse with anything but your own self shocks both you and the world with a sense of extravagance, as if a centaur pursued a nymph or fought with a hero. The soul⁠—or what we call the soul⁠—is struggling in the bondage of your unformed body. Lately you had no soul, you were ethereal and cold, yet withal in some remote way passionate, like your own boy’s voice. Now the silly sun is melting the snow, and what was a little while since crystalline clear virginity is beginning to trickle down towards a headlong course, carrying with it the soiled accumulation of the years to float insignificantly into the wide river of manhood. But I am really being almost intolerably allegorical⁠—or is it metaphorical?”</p>
			<p>“Still, I think I understand what you mean,” Michael said encouragingly.</p>
			<p>“Thrown back upon your own resources, it is not surprising that you attempt to allay your own sense of your own incongruity by seeking for its analogy in the decorative excitements of religion or poetry. Love would supply the solution, but you are still too immature for love. And if you do fall in love, you will sigh for some ample and unattainable matron rather than the slim, shy girl that would better become your pastoral graces. At present you lack all sense of proportion. You are only aware of your awkwardness. Your corners have not yet been, as they say, knocked off. You are still somewhat proud of their Gothic angularity. You feel at home in the tropic dawns of Swinburne’s poetry, in the ceremonious exaggerations of Mass, because neither of these conditions of thought and behaviour allow you to become depressed over your oddity, to see yourself crawling with bedraggled wings from the cocoon of mechanical education. The licentious ingenuity of Martial, Petronius and Apuleius with their nightmare comedies and obscene phantasmagoria, Lucian, that <i xml:lang="fr">boulevardier</i> of Olympic glades, all these could allow you to feel yourself more at home than does Virgil with his peaceful hexameters or the cold relentless narrations of Thucydides.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, that’s all very well,” objected Michael. “But other chaps seem to get on all right without being bored by ordinary things.”</p>
			<p>“Already spurning the gifts of Apollo, contemptuous of Artemis, ignorant of Bacchus and Aphrodite, you are bent low before Pallas Athene. Foolish child, do not pray for wisdom in this overwise thin-faced time of ours. Rather demand of the gods folly, and drive ever furiously your temperament like a chariot before you.”</p>
			<p>“I met an odd sort of chap the other day,” Michael said thoughtfully. “A monk he was, as a matter of fact⁠—who told me a skit of things⁠—you know⁠—about a bad life. It’s funny, though I hate ugly things and common things, he gave me a feeling that I’d like to go right away from everything and live in one of those horrible streets that you pass in an omnibus when the main road is up. Perhaps you don’t understand what I mean?”</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot’s eyes glittered through the haze of smoke.</p>
			<p>“Why shouldn’t I understand? Squalor is the Parthenope of the true Romantic. You’ll find it in all the poets you love best⁠—if not in their poetry, certainly in their lives. Even romantic critics are not without temptation. One day you shall read of Hazlitt and Sainte-Beuve. And now, dear boy, here is my library which holds as many secrets as the Spintrian books of Elephantis, long ago lost and purified by the sea. I am what the wise world would call about to corrupt your mind, and yet I believe that for one who like you must some day make trial of the uttermost corruption, I am prescribing more wisely than Chiron, that pigheaded or rather horse-bodied old prototype of all schoolmasters, who sent his hero pupils one after another into the world, proof against nothing but a few spear-thrusts. I offer you better than fencing-bouts and wrestling-matches. I offer you a good library. Read every day and all night, and when you are a man full grown, you will smile at the excesses of your contemporaries, at their divorces and disgraces. You will stand aloof like a second Aurelius, coining austere aphorisms and mocking the weakness of your unlearned fellows. Why are priests generally so inept in the confessional? Because they learn their knowledge of life from a frowsy volume of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Moral Theology</i> that in the most utterly barbarous Latin emits an abstract of humanity’s immeasurable vice. In the same way most young men encounter wickedness in some sudden shock of depravity from which they retire blushing and mumbling, ‘Who’d have thought it!’ ‘Who’d have thought it!’ they cry, and are immediately empanelled on a jury.</p>
			<p>“Not so you, O more subtle youth, with the large deep eyes and secret sidelong smile.</p>
			<p>“There on my shelves are all the ages. I have spoken to you of Petronius, of Lucian and Apuleius. There is Suetonius, with his incredibly improper tales that show how beastliness takes root and flowers from the deposited muck of a gossip’s mind. There is Tacitus, ever willing to sacrifice decency to antithesis, and Ausonius, whose ribald verses are like monkish recreation; yet he had withal a pretty currency of honest silver Latin, Christian though he was. You must read your Latin authors well, for, since you must be decadent, it is better to decay from a good source. And neglect not the Middle Ages. You will glide most easily into them from the witches and robbers of Apuleius. You will read Boccaccio, whose tales are intaglios carved with exquisitely licentious and Lilliputian scenes. Neither forget Villon, whose light ladies seem ever to move elusively in close-cut gowns of cloth-of-gold and incredibly tall steeple-hats. But even with Villon the world becomes complicated, and you will soon reach the temperamental entanglements of the nineteenth century, for you may avoid the coarse, the beery and besotted obviousness of the Georgian age.</p>
			<p>“But I like the eighteenth century almost best of all,” protested Michael.</p>
			<p>“Then cure yourself of that most lamentable and most démodé taste, or I shall presently believe that you read a page or two of Boswell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Johnson</i> every morning, while the water is running into your bath. You can never be a true decadent, treading delicately over the garnered perfection of the world’s art, if you really admire and enjoy the eighteenth century.”</p>
			<p>Michael, however, looked very doubtful over his demanded apostasy.</p>
			<p>“But, never mind,” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot went on. “When you have read Barbey d’Aurevilly and Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Verlaine, Catulle Mendès and Verhaeren, when the Parnassians and Symbolists have illuminated you, and you become an Interior person, when Aubrey Beardsley and Felicien Rops have printed their fierce debauchery upon your imagination, then you will be glad you have forsaken the eighteenth century. How crude is the actual number eighteen, how far from the passionate mystery of seventeen or the tired wisdom of nineteen! O wonderful nineteenth century, in whose grey humid dusk you and I are lucky enough to live!”</p>
			<p>“But what about the twentieth century?” asked Michael.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot started.</p>
			<p>“Listen, and I will tell you my intention. Two more years have yet to run before that garish and hideous date, prophetic of all that is bright and new and abominably raw. But I shall have fled, how I know not; haply mandragora will lure my weary mind to rest. I think I should like to die as <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.painting">La Gioconda</i> was painted, listening to flute-players in a curtained alcove; or you, Michael, shall read to me some diabolic and funereal song of Baudelaire, so that I may fearfully pass away.”</p>
			<p>Michael, sitting in the dim room of peacock-blue made tremendously nocturnal by the heavy smoke of all the cigarettes, did not much care for the turn the conversation of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot had taken. It had been interesting enough, while the discussion applied directly to himself; but all this vague effusion of learning meant very little to him. At the same time, there was an undeniable eccentricity in a member of the Upper Fifth sitting thus in fantastic communion with a figure completely outside the imagination of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cray or any of his inky groundlings. Michael began to feel a contemptuous pity for his fellows now buried in bedclothes, hot and heavy with Ciceronian sentences and pious preparation. He began to believe that if he wished to keep pace with this new friendship, he must acquire something of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot’s heightened air. And however mad he might seem, there stood the books, and there stood the cigarettes for Michael’s pleasure. It was all very exciting, and it would not have been possible to say that before he met Wilmot.</p>
			<p>The friendship progressed through the rest of the autumn-term, and Michael drifted farther away from the normal life of the school than even his incursion into Catholicism had taken him. That phase of his development had penetrated deeper than any other, and from time to time Michael knew bitter repentances and made grim resolutions. From time to time letters would arrive from Dom Cuthbert asking him down to Clere Abbey; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Viner, too, would question him narrowly about his new set of friends, and Michael’s replies never seemed perfectly satisfactory to the shrewd priest.</p>
			<p>It was by his costume more than by anything else that Michael expressed at first his sense of emancipation. He took to coming to school in vivid bow-ties that raised <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cray’s most sarcastic comments.</p>
			<p>“The sooner you go to the History Sixth, Fane, and take that loathsome ribbon with you, the better for us all. Where did you get it? Out of the housemaid’s trunk, one would say, by its appearance.”</p>
			<p>“It happens to be a tie,” said Michael with insolence in his tone.</p>
			<p>“Oh, it happens to be a tie, does it? Well, it also happens to be an excellent rule of <abbr>St.</abbr> James’ School that all boys, however clever, wear dark suits and black ties. There also happens to be an excellent cure for pretentious and flamboyant youths who disregard this rule. There happens to be a play by one Euripides called the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Alcestis</i>. I suggest you write me out the first two hundred lines of it.”</p>
			<p>Michael’s next encounter was with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Viner, on the occasion of his producing in the priest’s pipe-seasoned sitting-room a handkerchief inordinately perfumed with an Eastern scent lately discovered by Wilmot.</p>
			<p>“Good heavens, Michael, what Piccadilly breezes are you wafting into my respectable and sacerdotal apartment?”</p>
			<p>“I rather like scent,” explained Michael lamely.</p>
			<p>“Well, I don’t, so, for goodness’ sake don’t bring any more of it in here. Pah! Phew! It’s worse than a Lenten address at a fashionable church. Really, you know, these people you’re in with now are not at all good for you, Michael.”</p>
			<p>“They’re more interesting than any of the chaps at school.”</p>
			<p>“Are they? There used to be a saying in my undergraduate days, ‘Distrust a freshman that’s always seen with third-year men.’ No doubt the inference is often unjust, but still the proverb remains.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, but these people aren’t at school with me,” Michael observed.</p>
			<p>“No, I wish they were. They might be licked into better shape, if they were,” retorted the priest.</p>
			<p>“I think you’re awfully down on Wilmot just because I didn’t meet him in some churchy set. If it comes to that, I met some much bigger rotters than him at Clere.”</p>
			<p>“My dear Michael,” argued Father Viner, “the last place I should have been surprised to see Master Wilmot would be in a churchy set. Don’t forget that if religion is a saving grace, religiosity is a constitutional weakness. Can’t you understand that a priest like myself who has taken the average course, public-school, ’varsity, and theological college, meets a thundering lot of Wilmots by the way? My dear fellow, many of my best friends, many of the priests you’ve met in my rooms, were once upon a time every bit as decadent as the lilified Wilmot. They took it like scarlet fever or chickenpox, and feel all the more secure now for having had it. Decadence, as our friend knows it, is only a newfangled name for greensickness. It’s a healthy enough mental condition for the young, but it’s confoundedly dangerous for the grownup. The first pretty girl that looks his way cures it in a boy, if he’s a normal decent boy. I shouldn’t offer any objection to your behaviour, if you were being decadent with Mark Chator or Martindale or Rigg. Good heavens, the senior curate at the best East-end Mission, when he was at Oxford, used to walk down the High leading a lobster on a silver chain, and even that wasn’t original, for he stole the poor little fantastic idea from some precious French poet. But that senior curate is a very fine fellow today. No, no, this fellow Wilmot and all his set are very bad company for you, and I do not like your being decadent with these half-baked fancy-cakes.”</p>
			<p>Michael, however, would not admit that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Viner was right, and frequented the dangerous peacock-blue room in Edwardes Square more than ever. He took Chator there amongst others, and was immensely gratified to be solemnly warned at the end of the visit that he was playing with Hellfire. This seemed to him an interesting and original pastime, and he hinted to solemn, simple, spluttering old Chator of more truly Satanic mysteries.</p>
			<p>After Christmas Michael had his way and was moved into the History Sixth, mainly owing to the intervention of the Member for West Kensington. The History Sixth was presided over by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham, whose nominal aim in life was the amelioration of Jacobean athletics. From the fact that he wore an <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">M.C.C.</abbr> ribbon round his straw hat, and an Oxford University Authentic tie, it is probable that the legend of his former skill at cricket was justified. In reality he was much more interested in Liberalism than anything else, and persistently read Blue Books, underlining the dramatic moments of Royal Commissions and chewing his moustache through pages of dialogue hostile to his opinions. A rumour sped round the school that he had been invited to stand for Parliament, a rumour which Michael, on the strength of dining with the Member for West Kensington, flatly contradicted.</p>
			<p>The History Sixth classroom was a pleasant place, the only classroom in the school that ever saw the sun. Its windows looked out on the great green expanse of the school ground, where during the deserted hours of work the solitary roller moved sedately and ancient women weeded the pitches.</p>
			<p>There were only seven boys in the History Sixth. There was Strang, the Captain of the Eleven, who lounged through the dull Lent term and seemed, as he spread his bulk over the small desk, like a half-finished statue to which still adhered a fragment of uncarved stone. There was Terry, the Vice-Captain of the Fifteen and most dapper halfback that ever cursed forwards. He spent his time trying to persuade Strang to take an interest in Noughts and Crosses. There was beak-nosed Thomson who had gained an Exhibition at Selwyn College, Cambridge, and dark-eyed Mallock, whose father wrote columnar letters to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Times</i>. Burnaby, who shocked Michael very much by prophesying that a certain <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H. G.</abbr> Wells, now writing about Martian invasions, was the coming man, and Railton, a weedy and disconsolate recluse, made up with Michael himself the class-list.</p>
			<p>There was an atmosphere of rest about the History Sixth, a leisured dignity that contrasted very delightfully with the spectacled industry of the Upper Fifth. To begin with, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham was always ten minutes after every other master in entering his classroom. This habit allowed the members of his form to stroll gracefully along the corridors and watch one by one the cavernous doors of other classrooms absorb their victims. Michael would often go out of his way to pass <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cray’s room, in order to see with a luxurious sense of relief the intellectual convicts of the Upper Fifth hurrying to their prison. Many other conventions of school-life were slackened in the History Sixth. A slight eccentricity of attire was not considered unbecoming in what was, at any rate in its own opinion, a faintly literary society. The room was always open between morning and afternoon school, and it was not an uncommon sight to see members of the form reading novels in tip-tilted chairs. Most of the home work was set a week in advance, which did away with the unpleasant necessity of speculating on the “construe” or hurriedly cribbing with a hastily peppered variety of mistakes the composition of one’s neighbour. Much of the work was simple reading, and as for the essays, by a legal fiction they were always written during the three hours devoted to Mathematics. Tradition forbade any member of the History Sixth to take Mathematics seriously, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gaskell, the overworked Mathematical master, was not inclined to break this tradition. He used to write out a problem or two on the blackboard for the sake of appearances, and then settle down to the correction of his more serious pupils’ work, while the History Sixth devoted themselves to their more serious work. One of the great social earthquakes that occasionally devastate all precedent occurred when <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gaskell was away with influenza, and his substitute, an earnest young novice, tried to make Strang and Terry do a Quadratic Equation.</p>
			<p>“But, sir, we never do Mathematics.”</p>
			<p>“Well, what are you here for?” asked the novice. “What am <em>I</em> here for?”</p>
			<p>“We don’t know,” replied the History Sixth in unison; and the vendetta that followed the complaint of their behaviour to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham made the novice’s mastership a burden to him during <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Gaskell’s illness. Enraged conservatism called for reprisals, until <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham pointed out with a felicity acquired from long perusal of Parliamentary humour, “You are Jacobeans, not Jacobins,” and with this mild joke quenched the feud.</p>
			<p>The effect of his transference to the History Sixth made Michael more decadent than ever, for the atmosphere of his new class encouraged him along the orchidaceous path pointed out by Arthur Wilmot. He was not now decadent from any feeling of opposition to established things, but he was decadent from conviction of the inherent rightness of such a state. At first the phase had manifested itself in outward signs, a little absurdly; now his actual point of view was veering into accord with the externals.</p>
			<p>Sunday was a day at Edwardes Square from which Michael returned almost phosphorescent with decay. Sunday was the day on which <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wilmot gathered from all over London specimens of corruption that fascinated Michael with their exotic and elaborate behaviour. Nothing seemed worth while in such an assembly except a novel affectation. Everything was a pose. It was a pose to be effeminate in speech and gesture; it was a pose to drink absinthe; it was a pose to worship the devil; it was a pose to buy attenuated volumes of verse at an unnatural price, for the sake of owning a sonnet that was left out in the ordinary edition; it was a pose to admire pictures that to Michael at first were more like wallpapers than pictures; it was really a pose to live at all. Conversation at these delicate entertainments was like the conversations overheard in the anterooms of private asylums. Everyone was very willowy in his movements, whether he were smoking or drinking or looking for a box of matches. Michael attempted to be willowy at school once, but gave it up on being asked if he had fleas.</p>
			<p>One of the main charms at first of these Sunday afternoon gatherings was the way in which, one after another, every one of the guests would take Michael aside and explain how different he (the guest) was from all the rest of humanity. Michael was flattered, and used to become very intense and look very soul-searching, and interject sympathetic exclamations until he discovered that the confidant usually proceeded to another corner of the room to entrust someone else with his innermost heart. He became cynical after a while, especially when he found that the principal points of difference from the rest of the world were identical in every one of the numerous guests who sought his counsel and his sympathy.</p>
			<p>However, he never became cynical enough to distrust the whole school of thought and admit that Father Viner’s contempt was justifiable. If ever he had any doubts, he was consoled by assuring himself that at any rate these new friends were very artistic, and how important it was to be artistic no one could realize who was not at school.</p>
			<p>Under the pressure of his insistent temperament, Michael found his collection of statuettes and ecclesiastical bric-a-brac very depressing. As a youth of the Florentine Renaissance he could not congratulate himself upon his room, which was much too much unlike either a Carpaccio interior or an Aubrey Beardsley bedroom. Between these two his ambition wavered.</p>
			<p>One by one the statuettes were moved to the top of a wardrobe where for a while they huddled, a dusty and devoted crowd, until one by one they met martyrdom at the hands of the housemaid. In their place appeared Della Robbia reliefs and terra-cotta statuettes of this or that famous Greek youth. The muscular and tearful pictures of Guido Reni, the bland insipidities of Bouguereau soon followed the statuettes, meeting a comparable martyrdom by being hung in the servants’ bedroom. The walls of Michael’s room were papered with a brown paper, which was intended to be very artistic, but was really merely sad. It was lightened, however, by various daring pictures in black and red that after only a very short regard really did take shape as scenes of Montmartre. There were landscapes of the Sussex downs, with a slight atmosphere of Japan and landscapes of Japan that were not at all like Japan, but none the less beautiful for that. The books of devotion were banished to the company of superannuated Latin and Greek textbooks on the lower shelf of a cupboard in the morning-room, whose upper shelf was stacked with tinned fruits. Incense was still burnt, not as once to induce prayers to ascend, but to stupefy Michael with scent and warmth into an imitation of a drug-taker’s listless paradise. This condition was accentuated by erecting over the head of his bed a canopy of faded green satin, which gave him acute aesthetic pleasure, until one night it collapsed upon him in the middle of the night. Every piece of upholstery in the room was covered with art linens that with the marching years had ousted the art muslins of Michael’s childhood. He also covered with squares of the same material the gas brackets, pushing them back against the wall and relying for light upon candles only. Notwithstanding Wilmot’s talk about literature, the influence of Wilmot’s friends was too strong, and Michael could not resist the deckle-edges of negligible poets. As these were expensive, Michael’s library lacked scope, and he himself, reflecting his pastime, came to believe in the bitterness and sweetness and bitter-sweetness of the plaintive sinners who printed so elegantly on such permanent paper the versification of their irregularity.</p>
			<p>Irregularity was now being subjected to Michael’s process of idealistic alchemy, and since his conception of irregularity was essentially romantic, and since he shrank from sentiment, he was able to save himself, when presently all this decoration fell to pieces, and revealed naked unpleasantness. Nothing in his present phase had yet moved him so actually as his brief encounter with Brother Aloysius. That glimpse of a fearful and vital underworld had been to him romantic without trappings; it was a glimpse into an underworld to which one day he might descend, since it asked no sighing for the vanished joys of the past, for the rose-gardens of Rome. He began to play with the idea of departing suddenly from his present life and entering the spectral reality of the Seven Sisters Road, treading whatever raffish raddled pavement knew the hollow steps of a city’s prowlers. Going home on Sunday nights from the perfumed house in Edwardes Square and passing quickly and apprehensively figures that materialized in a circle of lamplight, he would contrast their existence with what remained in his senses of stale cigarette-smoke and self-conscious airs and attitudes. Yet the very picture he conjured of the possibility that haunted him made him the more anxious to substitute for the stark descent to hell the Sicilian or Satanic affectations of the luxurious mimes who postured against a background of art. Much of the talk at Edwardes Square concerned itself with the pastoral side of school-life, and Michael found himself being cross-questioned by elderly faun-like men who had a conception of an English public-school that was more Oriental than correct. Michael vainly tried to dispel these illusions, which made him resentful and for the moment crudely normal. He felt towards them much as he felt towards Garrod’s attempt to cure his ignorance at Clere. These were excellent fellows from whom to accept a cigarette or sometimes even an invitation to lunch at a Soho restaurant, but when they presumed upon his condescension and dared to include in their tainted outlook himself as a personal factor, Michael shrivelled with a virginal disdain.</p>
			<p>Unreasonably to the others, Michael did not object very much to Wilmot’s oracular addresses on the delights of youth. He felt that so much of Wilmot was in the mere word, and he admired so frankly his embroideries of any subject, and above all he liked Wilmot so much personally, that he listened to him, and was even so far influenced by him as to try to read into the commonplace of a summer term all that Wilmot would suggest.</p>
			<p>“O fortunate shepherd, to whom will you pipe tomorrow, or what slim and agile companion will you crown for his prowess? O lucky youth, able to drowse in the tempered sunlight that the elm-trees give, while your friend splendidly cool in his white flannels bats and bowls for your delight!”</p>
			<p>“But I haven’t got any particular friend that I can watch,” objected Michael.</p>
			<p>“One day you will terribly regret the privileges of your pastoral life.”</p>
			<p>“Do you really think I am not getting all I can out of school?” demanded Michael.</p>
			<p>“I’m sure you’re not,” said Wilmot.</p>
			<p>Michael began to trouble himself over Wilmot’s warning, and also he began to look back with sentimental regret to what had really been his happiest time, his friendship with Alan. Pride kept him from approaching Alan with nothing to offer for nearly two years’ indifference. There had been no quarrel. They had merely gradually drifted apart, yet it was with a deep pang of remorse that one day he realized in passing the dusty Upper Fifth that Alan was now wrestling with that imprisonment. Michael racked his brains to think of some way by which he and Alan might come together in their old amity, their perfect fellowship. He sought some way that would make it natural and inevitable, but no way presented itself. He could, so deep was his sudden regret, have stifled his own pride and deliberately invited Alan to be friends; he would even have risked a repulse; but with the renewal of his longing for the friendship came a renewal of the old sympathy and utter comprehension of Alan’s most secret moods, and Michael realized that his old friend would be too shy to accept this strange, inexplicable revival, unless it were renewed, as it was begun, by careless, artless intercourse.</p>
			<p>The immediate result of this looking back to an earlier period was to arouse in Michael an interest in boys younger than himself, and through his idealism to endow them with a conscious joy of life which he fell to envying. He had a desire to warn them of the enchantment under whose benign and dulcet influence they lived, to warn them that soon the lovely spell would be broken, and bid them make the most of their stripling time. Continually he was seeing boys in the lower forms whose friendship blooming like two flowers on a spray shed a fragrance so poignant that tears came springing to his eyes. He began to imagine himself very old, to feel that by some unkind gift of temperament he had nothing left to live for. It chanced that summer term the History Sixth learned for repetition the Odes of Keats, and in the Ode on a Grecian Urn Michael found the expression of his mood:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though winning near the goal⁠—yet, do not grieve;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>These lines were learnt in June, and for Michael they enshrined immortally his yearning. Never had the fugitive summer glided so fast, since never before had he sat in contemplation of its flight. Until this moment he had been one with the season’s joy like a bird or a sunbeam, but now for the first time he had the opportunity of regarding the empty field during the hours of school, and of populating it with the merry ghosts of the year with Caryll. All through schooltime the mowing-machine hummed its low harmony of perishable minutes and wasted sunlight. The green field was scattered with the wickets of games in progress that stood luminously in golden trios, so brightly did the sunny weather enhance their wood. The scoring-board of the principal match stared like a stopped clock with the record of the last breathless run, and as if to mock the stillness from a distant corner came a sound of batting, where at the nets the two professionals practised idly. A bluebottle buzzed upon the windowpane; pigeons flapped from pinnacle to pinnacle of the chapel; sparrows cheeped on a persistent note; pens scratched paper; <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham turned a Blue Book’s page at regular intervals.</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, happy melodist, unwearied</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ever piping songs for ever new.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Thus for him would the trancèd scene forever survive.</p>
			<p>The History Sixth were for the purposes of cricket linked to the Classical Lower Sixth, but Michael did not play that term. Instead, a strayed reveller, he would move from game to game of the Junior School, hearing the shrill encouragement and pondering the rose-red agility of a Classical lower form, in triumph over minor Moderns. Michael was continually trying to perceive successors to himself and Alan, and he would often enter into shy colloquy with the juniors, who were awed by his solemn smile, and shuffled uneasily from leg to leg.</p>
			<p>Two boys whom Michael finally determined should stand as types of Alan and him gradually emerged from the white throng of Lower School cricket. One of them was indeed very like Alan, and had the same freckled smile. With this pair Michael became intimate, as one becomes intimate with two puppies. He would pet and scold them, encourage them to be successful in their sport, and rebuke them for failure. They perhaps found him entertaining, and were certainly proud to be seen in conversation with him, for though Michael himself was not an athletic hero, he was the companion of heroes, and round him clung the shining mirage of their immortality.</p>
			<p>Then one day, unknown to Michael, these two boys became involved in a scandal; the inquisition of a great public school pinned them down desperately struggling, miserably afraid; the rumour of their expulsion went callously round the gossiping ranks of their fellows. Michael was informed of their disgrace by dark-eyed Mallock whose father wrote columnar letters to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Times</i>. Michael said bitter things to the complacent Mallock and offered with serious want of dignity for a member of the leisurely and cultivated History Sixth, to punch Mallock’s damned head.</p>
			<p>Mallock said sneeringly that he supposed Michael sympathized with the little beasts. Michael replied that he merely sympathized with them because he was profoundly sure that it was a pack of lies.</p>
			<p>“You’d better go and tell the Old Man that, because they say he’s going to expel them today.”</p>
			<p>Michael turned pale with fury.</p>
			<p>“I damned well will go, and when I come back I’ll ram you upside down in the Tuck Shop butter-tub.”</p>
			<p>Mallock flushed under the ignominy of this threat, and muttered his conviction that Michael was talking through his hat. Just then <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham entered the classroom, and Michael immediately went up to him and asked if he might go and speak to the Headmaster.</p>
			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham stared with amazement, and his voice, which always seemed to hesitate whether it should come out through his mouth or his nose, on this occasion never came out at all, but stayed in the roof of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham’s mouth.</p>
			<p>“Can I, sir?” Michael repeated.</p>
			<p>“I suppose you can,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Kirkham.</p>
			<p>The class followed Michael’s exit with wide eyes; even the phlegmatic Strang was so deeply moved that he sat upright in his chair and tapped his head to indicate midsummer madness.</p>
			<p>Outside in the echoing corridor, where the plaster casts looked coldly down, Michael wrestled with his leaping heart, forcing it into tranquillity so that he could grapple with the situation he had created for himself. By the <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.sculpture">Laocoön</i> he paused. Immediately beyond was the sombre doorway of the Head’s room. As he paused on the threshold two ridiculous thoughts came to him⁠—that Lessing’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laocoön</i> was one of the set books for the English Literature prize, and that he would rather be struggling in the coils of that huge stone snake than standing thus invertebrate before this portentous door.</p>
			<p>Then Michael tapped. There was no answer but a dull buzz of voices. Again Michael tapped and, beating down his heart, turned the handle that seemed as he held it to swell to pumpkin size in his grasp. Slowly he pushed the door before him, expecting to hear a bellowed summons to appear, and wondering whether he could escape unknown to his classroom if his nerve failed him even now. Then he heard the sound of tears, and indignation drove him onwards, drove him so urgently that actually he slammed the great door behind him, and made the intent company aware of his presence.</p>
			<p>“What do <em>you</em> want?” shouted <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Brownjohn. “Can’t you see I’m busy?”</p>
			<p>“I want to speak to you, sir.” The words actually seemed to come from his mouth winged with flames, such a volcano was Michael now.</p>
			<p>“I’m busy. Go outside and wait,” roared the Headmaster.</p>
			<p>Michael paused to regard the scene⁠—the two boys sobbing with painful regular intake of breath, oblivious of him; the witnesses, a sheepish crew; the school-porter waiting for his prey; old <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Caryll coughing nervously and apparently on the verge of tears himself; the odious Paul Pry of a Secretary nibbling his pen; and in the background other masters waiting with favourable or damning testimony.</p>
			<p>The drama of gloating authority shook Michael to the very foundation of his being, and he came rapidly into the middle of the room, came right up to the Headmaster, until he felt engulfed in the black silk gown, and at last said slowly and with simple conviction:</p>
			<p>“I think you’re all making a mistake.”</p>
			<p>When he had spoken Michael could have kicked himself for not shouting furiously the torrid denunciations which had come surging up for utterance. Then he immediately began to talk again, to his own great surprise, calmly and very reasonably.</p>
			<p>“I know these kids⁠—these two boys, I mean⁠—quite well. It’s impossible for any of this to be true. I’ve seen them a lot this term⁠—practically every day. Really, sir, you’ll make a terrible mistake if you expel them. They’re awfully decent little chaps. They are really, sir. Of course they’re too frightened now to say anything for themselves. It’s not fair for everybody to be set at them like this.”</p>
			<p>Michael looked despairingly at the masters assembled.</p>
			<p>“And these other boys who’ve been brought in to tell what they know. Why, they’re frightened too. They’d say anything. Why don’t you, why don’t you⁠—”</p>
			<p>Michael looked round in despair, stammered, broke down, and then to his own eternal chagrin burst into tears. He moved hastily over to the window, striving to pull himself together, seeing through an overpowering blur the great green field in the garish sunlight. Yet his tears, shameful to him, may have turned the scale, for one by one the masters came forward with eager testimony of good; and with every word of praise the tears rushed faster and faster to Michael’s eyes. Then he heard old Caryll’s rasping cough and broken benignant sentences, which with all their memories lulled his emotion to quietude again.</p>
			<p>“Hope you’ll bring it in <i xml:lang="la">non probatum</i>, Headmaster”⁠—cough⁠—cough⁠—“good boys both”⁠—cough⁠—cough⁠—“sure it’s a mistake⁠—Fane’s a good boy too⁠—idle young rascal⁠—but a good heart”⁠—cough⁠—cough⁠—“had him under me for a year⁠—know him well⁠—”</p>
			<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Brownjohn, with a most voluminous wave, dismissed the matter. Everyone, even the Paul Pry of a Secretary, went out of the room, and as the door closed Michael heard <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Caryll addressing the victims.</p>
			<p>“Now then, don’t cry any more, you young boobies.”</p>
			<p>Michael’s thoughts followed them upstairs to the jolly classroom, and he almost smiled at the imagination of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Caryll’s entrance and the multitudinous jokes that would demonstrate his relief at his pupils’ rescue. Michael recovered from his dream to find the Headmaster speaking to him in his most rumbling bass.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know why I allowed you to interfere in this disgraceful affair, boy. Um?”</p>
			<p>“No, sir,” Michael agreed.</p>
			<p>“But since you are here, I will take the opportunity of warning you that the company you keep is very vile.”</p>
			<p>Michael looked apprehensive.</p>
			<p>“If you think nothing is known of your habits out of school, you are much mistaken. I will not have any boy at my school frequenting the house of that deboshed nincompoop Wilmot.”</p>
			<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Brownjohn’s voice was now so deep that it vibrated in the pit of Michael’s stomach like the diapason of the school organ.</p>
			<p>“Give up that detestable association of mental impostors and be a boy again. You have disappointed me during the whole of your career; but you’re a winning boy. Um? Go back to your work.”</p>
			<p>Michael left the august room with resolves swaying in his brain, wondering what he could do to repay the Old Man. It was too late to take a very high place in the summer examinations. Yet somehow, so passionate was his gratitude, he managed to come out third.</p>
			<p>Michael never told his mother about his adventure, but in the reaction against Wilmot and all that partook of decadence, and in his pleasure at having done something, however clumsily, he felt a great wish to include his mother in his emotion of universal love.</p>
			<p>“Where are we going these holidays?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“I thought perhaps you’d like to stay at your monastery again,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane. “I was thinking of going abroad.”</p>
			<p>Michael’s face fell, and his mother was solicitously penitent.</p>
			<p>“My dearest boy, I never dreamed you would want to be with me. You’ve always gone out on Sundays.”</p>
			<p>“I know, I’m sorry, I won’t again,” Michael assured her.</p>
			<p>“And I’ve made my arrangements now. I wish I’d known. But why shouldn’t you go and see Stella? It seems a pity that you and she should grow up so much apart.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I will, if you like,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“Dearest boy, what has happened to you? You are so agreeable,” exclaimed <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane.</p>
			<p>In the end it was arranged that Michael should accompany <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Viner on his holiday in France, and afterwards stay with Stella with a family at Compiègne for the rest of the time. Michael went to see his mother off at Charing Cross before he joined <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Viner.</p>
			<p>“Darling Michael,” she murmured as the train began to move slowly forward. “You’re looking so well and happy⁠—just like you were two years ago. Just like⁠—”</p>
			<p>The rest of the comparison was lost in the noise of the speeding train.</p>
