				</hgroup>
				<p>Alan, when he met Michael at Paddington, was a great deal more cheerful than when they had gone up together for the previous term. He had managed to achieve a second class in Moderations, and he had now in view a term of cricket whose energy might fortunately be crowned with a blue. Far enough away now seemed Greats and not very alarming Plato and Aristotle at these first tentative encounters.</p>
				<p>Michael dined with Alan at Christ Church after the Seniors’ match, in which his host had secured in the second innings four wickets at a reasonable price. Alan casually nodded to one or two fellow hosts at the guest table, but did not offer to introduce Michael. All down the hall, men were coming in to dinner and going out of dinner as unconcernedly as if it had been the dining-saloon of a large hotel.</p>
				<p>“Who is that man just sitting down?” Michael would ask.</p>
				<p>“I don’t know,” Alan would reply, and in his tone would somehow rest the implication that Michael should know better than to expect him to be aware of each individual in this very much subdivided college.</p>
				<p>“Did you hear the hockey push broke the windows of the socker push in Peck?” asked one of the Christ Church hosts.</p>
				<p>“No, really?” answered Alan indifferently.</p>
				<p>After hall as they walked back to Meadows’, Michael tried to point out to him that the <abbr>St.</abbr> Mary’s method of dining in hall was superior to that of the House.</p>
				<p>“The dinner itself is better,” Alan admitted. “But I hate your system of all getting up from table at the same time. It’s like school.”</p>
				<p>“But if a guest comes to <abbr>St.</abbr> Mary’s he sits at his host’s regular table. He’s introduced to everybody. Why, Alan, I believe if you’d had another guest tonight, you wouldn’t even have introduced me to him. He and I would have had to drink coffee in your rooms like a couple of dummies.”</p>
				<p>“Rot!” said Alan. “And whom could you have wanted to meet this evening? All the men at the guests’ table were absolute ticks.”</p>
				<p>“I’ve never met a House man who didn’t think every other House man impossible outside the four people in his own set,” retorted Michael. “And yet, I suppose, you’ll say it’s the best college?”</p>
				<p>“Of course,” Alan agreed.</p>
				<p>Up in his rooms they pondered the long May day’s reluctant death, while the coffee-machine bubbled and fizzed and <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.painting">The Soul’s Awakening</i> faintly kindled by the twilight was appropriately sentimental.</p>
				<p>“Will you have a meringue?” Alan asked. “I expect there’s one in the cupboard.”</p>
				<p>“I’m sure there is,” said Michael. “It’s very unlikely that there is a single cupboard in the House without a meringue. But no, thanks, all the same.”</p>
				<p>They forsook the window-seat and pulled wicker-chairs very near to the tobacco-jar squatting upon the floor between them: they lit their pipes and sipped their coffee. For Alan the glories of the day floated before him in the smoke.</p>
				<p>“It’s a pity,” he said, “Sterne missed that catch in the slips. Though of course I wasn’t bowling for the slips. Five for forty-eight would have looked pretty well. Still four for forty-eight isn’t so bad in an innings of 287. The point is whether they can afford to give a place to another bowler who’s no earthly use as a bat. It seems a bit of a tail. I went in eighth wicket both innings. Two⁠—first knock. Blob⁠—second. Still four for forty-eight was certainly the best. I ought to play in the first trial match.” So Alan voiced his hopes.</p>
				<p>“Of course you will,” said Michael. “And at Lord’s. I think I shall ask my mother and sister up for Eights,” he added.</p>
				<p>Alan looked rather disconcerted.</p>
				<p>“What’s the matter?” Michael asked. “You won’t have to worry about them. I’ll explain you’re busy with cricket. Stella inquired after you in a letter this week.”</p>
				<p>During the Easter vacation Alan had stayed once or twice in Cheyne Walk, and Stella who had come back from an arduous time with music and musical people in Germany had seemed to take a slightly sharper interest in his existence.</p>
				<p>“Give her my⁠—er⁠—love, when you write,” said Alan very nonchalantly. “And I don’t think I’d say anything about those four wickets for forty-eight. I don’t fancy she’s very keen on cricket. It might bore her.”</p>
				<p>No more was said about Stella that evening, and nothing indeed was said about anything except the seven or eight men competing for the three vacancies in the Varsity eleven. At about a quarter to ten Alan announced as usual that “those men will be coming down soon for cocoa.”</p>
				<p>“Alan, who are these mysterious creatures that come down for cocoa at ten?” asked Michael. “And why am I never allowed to meet them?”</p>
				<p>“They’d bore you rather,” said Alan. “They’re people who live on this staircase. I don’t see them any other time.”</p>
				<p>Michael thought Alan would be embarrassed if he insisted on staying, so to his friend’s evident relief he got up to go.</p>
				<p>“You House men are like a lot of old bachelors with your fads and regularities,” he grumbled.</p>
				<p>“Stay, if you like,” said Alan, not very heartily. “But I warn you they’re all awfully dull, and I’ve made a rule to go to bed at half-past ten this term.”</p>
				<p>“So long,” said Michael hurriedly, and vanished.</p>
				<p>A few days later Michael had an answer from his mother to his invitation for Eights Week:</p>

					<p>I wish you’d asked me sooner. Now I have made arrangements to help at the Italian Peasant Jewelry Stall in this big bazaar at Westminster Hall for the Society for the Improvement of the Condition of Agricultural Laborers all over the world. I think you’d be interested. It’s all about handicrafts. Weren’t you reading a book by William Morris the other day? His name is mentioned a great deal always. I’ve been meeting so many interesting people. If Stella comes, why not ask <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross to chaperone her? Such a capital idea. And do be nice about poor Dick Prescott. Stella is so young and impulsive. I wish she could understand how <em>much much</em> happier she would be married to a nice man, even though he may be a little older than herself. This tearing all over Europe cannot be good for her. And now she talks of going to Vienna and studying under somebody with a perfectly impossible name beginning with <i epub:type="z3998:grapheme">L</i>. Not only that, but she also talks of unlearning all she has learned and beginning all over again. This is most absurd, and I’ve tried to explain to her. She should have thought of this man beginning with <i epub:type="z3998:grapheme">L</i> before. At her age to start scales and exercises again does seem ridiculous. I really dread Stella’s coming of age. Who knows what she may not take it into her head to do? I can’t think where she gets this curious vein of eccentricity. I’ll write to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross if you like. Stella, of course, says she can go to Oxford by herself, but that I will not hear of, and I beg you not to encourage the idea, if she suggests it to you.</p>

				<p>Michael thought <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross would solve the difficulty, and he was glad rather to relieve himself of the responsibility of his mother at Oxford. He would have had to be so steadily informative, and she would never have listened to a word. Stella’s view of the visit came soon after her mother’s.</p>

					<p>What’s all this about <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross chaperoning me at Oxford? Is it necessary? At a shot I said to mother, “No, quite unnecessary.” But of course, if I should disgrace you by coming alone, I won’t. Isn’t <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross a little on the heavy side? I mean, wouldn’t she rather object to me smoking cigars?</p>

				<p>“Great scott!” interjaculated Michael.</p>

				</blockquote>
				<p>Michael agreed with his mother in thinking a chaperone was absolutely necessary for Stella’s visit to Oxford, and since the threat of cigars he cordially approved of the suggestion that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross should come. Moreover, he felt his former governess would approve of his own attitude toward Oxford, and he rather looked forward to demonstrating it to her. In the full-blooded asceticism of Oxford Michael censured his own behavior when he was seventeen and looked back with some dismay on the view of himself at that time as it appeared to him now. He was as much shocked by that period now as at school in his fifteenth year he had been shocked by the memory of the two horrid little girls at Eastbourne. Altogether this invitation seemed an admirable occasion to open the door once again to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross and to let her personality enter his mind as the sane adjudicator of whatever problems should soon present themselves. It would be jolly for Alan, too, if his aunt came up and saw him playing for the Varsity in whatever cricket match was provided to relieve the tedium of too much rowing.</p>
				<p>So finally, after one or two more protests from Stella, it was arranged that she should come up for Eights Week under the guardianship of <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross.</p>
				<p>Michael took care some time beforehand to incorporate a body of assistant entertainers. Lonsdale in consideration of Michael having helped him with his people for one day last year was engaged for the whole visit. Maurice was made to vow attendance for at least every other occasion. Wedderburn volunteered his services. Guy Hazlewood, who was threatened with Schools, was let off with a lunch. Nigel Stewart spoke mysteriously of a girl whose advent he expected on which account he could not pledge himself too straightly. Rooms were taken in the High. Trains were looked out. On Saturday morning Lonsdale and Michael went down to the station to meet <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross and Stella.</p>
				<p>“I think it was a very bad move bringing me,” said Lonsdale, as they waited on the platform. “Your sister will probably think me an awful ass, and⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>But the train interrupted Lonsdale’s self-depreciation, and he sustained himself well through the crisis of the introductions. Michael thought <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross had never so well been suited by her background as now when tall and straight and in close-fitting gray dress she stood in the Oxford sunlight. Stella, too, in that flowered muslin relieved Michael instantly of the faint anxiety he had conceived lest she might appear in a Munich garb unbecoming to a reserved landscape. It was a very peculiarly feminine dress, but somehow she had never looked more like a boy, and her gray eyes, as for one moment she let them rest wide open on the city’s towers and spires, were more than usually gray and pellucid.</p>
				<p>“I say, I ordered a car to meet us,” said Lonsdale. “I thought we should buzz along quicker.”</p>
				<p>“What you really thought,” said Michael, “was that you would have to drive my sister in a hansom.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no, I say, really,” protested Lonsdale.</p>
				<p>“I’m much more frightened of you than you could ever be of me,” Stella declared.</p>
				<p>“Oh no, I say, really, are you? But I’m an awful ass, Miss Fane,” said Lonsdale encouragingly. “Hallo, here’s the jolly old car.”</p>
				<p>As they drove past the castle, Lonsdale informed Stella it was the county gaol, and when they reached the gaol he told her it was probably Worcester College, or more familiarly Wuggins.</p>
				<p>“You’ll only have to tell her that All Souls is the County Asylum and that Queens is a marmalade factory, and she’ll have a pretty good notion of the main points of interest in the neighborhood,” said Michael.</p>
				<p>“He always rags me,” explained Lonsdale, smiling confidentially round at the visitors. “I say, isn’t Alan Merivale your nephew?” he asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross. “He’s playing for the Varsity against Surrey. Sent down some very hot stuff yesterday. We ought to buzz round to the Parks after lunch and watch the game for a bit.”</p>
				<p>Wedderburn, who had been superintending the preparations for lunch, met them in the lodge with a profound welcome, having managed to put at least twenty years on to his age. Lunch had been laid in Lonsdale’s rooms, since he was one of the few men in college who possessed a dining-room in addition to a sitting-room. Yet, notwithstanding that Michael had invited the guests and that they were lunching in Lonsdale’s rooms, to Wedderburn by all was the leadership immediately accorded.</p>
				<p>The changeless lunch of Eights Week with its salmon mayonnaise and cold chicken and glimpses through the windows of pink and blue dresses going to and fro across the green quadrangles, with its laughter and talk and speculations upon the weather, with its overheated scout and scent of lilac and hawthorn, went its course: as fugitive a piece of mirthfulness as the dance of the mayflies over the Cher.</p>
				<p>After lunch they walked to the Parks to watch Alan playing for the Varsity. Wedderburn, who with people to entertain feared nothing and nobody, actually went coolly into the pavilion and fetched out Alan who was already in pads, waiting to go in. Michael watched very carefully Alan’s meeting with Stella, watched Alan’s face fall when he saw her beside Maurice and marked how nervously he fidgeted with his gloves. There was a broken click from the field of play. It was time for Alan to go in. Michael wished very earnestly he could score a brilliant century so that Stella hearing the applause could realize how much there was in him to admire. Yet ruefully he admitted to himself the improbability of Stella realizing anything at all about the importance of cricket. However, he had scarcely done with his wishing, when he saw Alan coming gloomily back from the wicket, clean bowled by the very first ball he had received.</p>
				<p>“Of course, you know, he isn’t played for his batting,” he hastened to explain to Stella.</p>
				<p>She, however, was too deeply engaged in discussing Vienna with Maurice to pay much attention, even when Alan sat down despondently beside them, unbuckling his pads. It was just as Michael had feared, fond though he was of Maurice.</p>
				<p>The last Varsity player was soon out, and Wedderburn proposed an early tea in his rooms to be followed by the river. Turning into Holywell, they met Guy Hazlewood, who said without waiting to be introduced to <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross and Stella:</p>
				<p>“My dear people, I fall upon your necks. Suggest something for me to do that for one day and one night will let me entirely forget Schools. We can’t bear our digs any longer.”</p>
				<p>“Why don’t you give a party there on Monday night,” suggested Wedderburn deeply.</p>
				<p>“Let me introduce you to Mrs.’sss⁠ ⁠… my sissss⁠ ⁠… <abbr>Mr.</abbr> H’wood,” mumbled Michael in explanation of Wedderburn’s proposal.</p>
				<p>“What a charming idea,” drawled Guy. “But isn’t it rather a shame to ask Miss Fane to play? Anyway, I daren’t.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no,” said Stella. “I should rather like to play in Oxford.”</p>
				<p>So after a kaleidoscope of racing and a Sunday picnic on the upper river, when everybody ate as chickens drink with a pensive upward glance at the trend of the clouds, occurred Guy Hazlewood’s party in Holywell, which might more truly have been called Wedderburn’s party, since he at once assumed all responsibility for it.</p>
				<p>The digs were much more crowded than anybody had expected, chiefly on account of the Balliol men invited.</p>
				<p>“Half Basutoland seems to be here,” Lonsdale whispered to Michael.</p>
				<p>“Well, with Hazlewood, Comeragh and Anstruther, all sons of Belial, what else can you expect?” replied Michael.</p>
				<p>Stella had seemed likely at first to give the favor of her attention more to Hazlewood than to anybody else, but Maurice was in a dauntless mood and, with Guy handicapped by having to pretend to assent to Wedderburn’s suggestions for entertainment, he managed at last to monopolize Stella almost entirely. Alan had declined the invitation with the excuse of wanting a steady hand and eye for tomorrow. But Michael fancied there was another reason.</p>
				<p>Stella played three times and was much applauded.</p>
				<p>“Very sporting effort, by Jove,” said Lonsdale, and this was probably the motive of most of the commendation, though there was a group of really musical people in the darkest corner who emerged between each occasion and condoled with Michael on having to hear his sister play in such inadequate surroundings.</p>
				<p>Michael himself was less moved by Stella’s playing than he had ever been. Nor was this coldness due to any anxiety for her success. He was sure enough of that in this uncritical audience.</p>
				<p>“Do you think Stella plays as well as she did?” he asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross.</p>
				<p>“Perhaps this evening she may be a little excited,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross suggested.</p>
				<p>“Perhaps,” said Michael doubtfully. “But what I mean is that, if she isn’t going to advance quite definitely, there really isn’t any longer an excuse for her to arrogate to herself a special code of behavior.”</p>
				<p>“Stella says a great deal more than she does,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross reassured him. “You’d be surprised, as indeed I was surprised, to find how simple and childlike she really is. I think an audience is never good for her.”</p>
				<p>“But, after all, her life is going to be one audience after another in quick succession,” Michael pointed out.</p>
				<p>“Gradually an audience will cease to rouse her into any violence of thought or accentuation of superficial action⁠—oh, Michael,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross exclaimed, breaking off, “what dreadfully long words you’re tempting me to use, and why do you make me talk about Stella? I’d really rather talk about you.”</p>
				<p>“Stella is becoming a problem to me,” said Michael.</p>
				<p>“And you yourself are no longer a problem to yourself?” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross inquired.</p>
				<p>“Not in the sense I was, when we last talked together.”</p>
				<p>Michael was a little embarrassed by recalling that conversation. It seemed to link him too closely for his pleasure to the behavior which had led up to it, to be a part of himself at the time, farouche and uncontrolled.</p>
				<p>“And all worries have passed away?” persisted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross.</p>
				<p>“Yes, yes,” said Michael quickly. “For one thing,” he added as if he thought he had been too abrupt, “I’m too comfortably off to worry much about anything. Boredom is the only problem I shall ever have to face. Seriously though, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross, I really am rather shocked when I think of myself as sixteen and seventeen.” Michael was building brick by brick a bridge for <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross to step over the chasm of three years. “I seem to see myself,” he persevered, “with very untidy hair, with very loose joints, doing and saying and thinking the most impossible things. I blush now at the memory of myself, just as I should blush now with Oxford snobbishness to introduce a younger brother like myself then, say to the second-year table in hall.” Michael paused for a moment, half hoping <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross would assure him he had caricatured his former self, but as she said nothing, he continued: “When I came up to Oxford I found that the natural preparation for Oxford was not a day-school like <abbr>St.</abbr> James’, but a boarding-school. Therefore I had to acquire in a term what most of my contemporaries had been given several years to acquire. I remember quite distinctly my father saying to my mother, ‘By gad, Valérie, he ought to go to Eton, you know,’ and my mother disagreeing, ‘No, no, I’m sure you were right when you said <abbr>St.</abbr> James’.’ That’s so like mother. She probably had never thought the matter out at all. She was probably perfectly vague about the difference between <abbr>St.</abbr> James’ and Eton, but because it had been arranged so, she disliked the idea of any alteration. I’m telling you all this because, you know, you provided as it were the public-school influence for my early childhood. After you I ought to have passed on to a private school entirely different from Randell House, and then to Eton or Winchester. I’m perfectly sure I could have avoided everything that happened when I was sixteen or seventeen, if I’d not been at a London day-school.”</p>
				<p>“But is it altogether fair to ascribe everything to your school?” asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross. “Alan for instance came very successfully, as far as normality is concerned, through <abbr>St.</abbr> James’.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, but Alan has the natural goodness of the average young Englishman. Possibly he benefited by <abbr>St.</abbr> James’. Possibly at Eton, and with a prospect of money, he would have narrowed down into a mere athlete, into one of the rather objectionable bigots of the public-school theory. Now I was never perfectly normal. I might even have been called morbid and unhealthy. I should have been, if I hadn’t always possessed a sort of curious lonely humor which was about twice as severe as the conscience of tradition. At the same time, I had nothing to justify my abnormality. No astounding gift of genius, I mean.”</p>
				<p>“But, Michael,” interrupted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross, “I don’t fancy the greatest geniuses in the world ever justified themselves at sixteen or seventeen.”</p>
				<p>“No, but they must have been upheld by the inner consciousness of greatness. You get that tremendously through all the despondencies of Keats’ letters for instance. I have never had that. Stella absorbed all the creative and interpretative force that was going. I never have and never shall get beyond sympathy, and even the value that gives my criticism is to a certain extent destroyed by the fact that the moment I try to express myself more permanently than by mouth, I am done.”</p>
				<p>“But still, I don’t see why a day-school should have militated against the development of that sympathetic and critical faculty.”</p>
				<p>“It did in this way,” said Michael. “It gave me too much with which to sympathize before I could attune my sympathy to criticism. In fact I was unbalanced. Eton would have adjusted this balance. I’m sure of that, because since I’ve been at Oxford I find my powers of criticism so very much saner, so very much more easily economized. I mean to say, there’s no wastage in futile emotions. Of course, it’s partly due to being older.”</p>
				<p>“Really, Michael,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross protested, “if you talk like this I shall begin to regret your earlier extravagance. This dried-up self-confidence seems to me not quite normal either.”</p>
				<p>“Ah, that’s only because I’m criticizing my earlier self. I really am now in a delightful state of cool judgment. Once I used to want passionately to be like everybody else. I thought that was the goal of social happiness. Then I wanted to be violently and conspicuously different from everybody else. Now I seem to be getting near the right mean between the two extremes. I’m enjoying Oxford enormously. I can’t tell you how happy I am here, how many people I like. And I appreciate it so much the more because to a certain extent at first it was a struggle to find that wide normal road on which I’m strolling along now. I’m so positive that the best of Oxford is the best of England, and that the best of England is the best of humanity that I long to apply to the world the same standards we tacitly respect⁠—we undergraduates. I believe every problem of life can be solved by the transcendency of the spirit which has transcended us up here. You remember I used to say you were like Pallas Athene? Well, just those qualities in you which made me think of that resemblance I find in Oxford. Don’t ask me to say what they are, because I couldn’t explain.”</p>
				<p>“I think you have a great capacity for idealization,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross gravely. “I wonder how you are going to express it practically. I wonder what profession you’ll choose.”</p>
				<p>“I don’t suppose I shall choose a profession at all,” said Michael. “There’s no financial reason⁠—at any rate⁠—why I should.”</p>
				<p>“Well, you won’t have to decide against a profession just yet,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross. “And now tell me, just to gratify my curiosity, why you think Stella’s playing has deteriorated⁠—if you really think it has.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, I didn’t say it had,” Michael contradicted in some dismay. “I merely said that tonight it did not seem up to her level. Perhaps she was anxious. Perhaps she felt among all these undergraduates, as I felt in my first week. Perhaps she’s thinking what schoolboys they all are, and how infinitely youthful they appear beside those wild and worldly-wise Bohemians to whose company she has been accustomed for so long. I long to tell her that these undergraduates are really so much wiser, even if literature means <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Soapy Sponge’s Sporting Tour</i>, and art <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.painting">The Soul’s Awakening</i>, and religion putting on a bowler to go and have a hot breakfast at the <abbr class="initialism">O.U.D.S.</abbr> after chapel, and politics the fag-ends of paternal or rather ancestral opinion, and life a hot bath and changing after a foxhunt or a grouse-drive.”</p>
				<p>Farther conversation was stopped by Wedderburn driving everybody down to supper with pastoral exhortations in his deepest bass. Michael, after his talk with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross, was relieved to find himself next to Lonsdale and sheltered by a quivering rampart of jellies from more exacting company.</p>
				<p>“These Basutos aren’t so bad when you talk to them,” said Lonsdale. “Comeragh was at m’tutor’s. I wonder if he still collects bugs. I rather like that man Hazlewood. I thought him a bit sidy at first, but he’s rather keen on fishing. I don’t think much of the girl that Trinity man⁠—what’s his name⁠—Stewart has roped in. She looks like something left over from a needlework stall. I say, your sister jolly well knows how to punch a piano. Topping, what? Mossy’s been very much on the spot tonight. He and Wedders are behaving like a couple of theatrical managers. Why didn’t Alan Merivale turn up? I was talking to some of the cricket push at the Club, and it doesn’t look a hundred quid to a tanner on his Blue. Bad luck. He’s a very good egg.”</p>
				<p>Michael listened vaguely to Lonsdale’s babble. He was watching the passage of the cigars and cigarettes down the table. Thank heaven, Stella had let the cigars go by.</p>
				<p>The party of 196 Holywell broke up. Outside in the shadowy street of gables they stood laughing and talking for a moment. Guy Hazlewood, Comeragh and Anstruther looked down from the windows at their parting guests.</p>
				<p>“It’s been awfully ripping,” these murmured to their hosts. The hosts beamed down.</p>
				<p>“We’ve been awfully bucked up by everything. Special vote of thanks to Miss Fane.”</p>
				<p>“You ought all to get Firsts now,” said Wedderburn.</p>
				<p>Then he and Lonsdale and Michael and Maurice set off with Stella and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Ross to the High Street rooms. In different directions the rest of the party vanished on echoing footsteps into the moon-bright spaces, into the dark and narrow entries. Voices faint and silvery rippled along the spellbound airs of the May night. The echoing footsteps died out to whispers. There was a whizzing of innumerable clocks, and midnight began to clang.</p>
				<p>“We must hurry,” said the escort, and they ran off down the High toward <abbr>St.</abbr> Mary’s, reaching the lodge on the final stroke.</p>
				<p>“Shall I come up to your rooms for a bit?” Maurice suggested to Michael.</p>
				<p>“I’m rather tired,” objected Michael, who divined that Maurice was going to talk at great length about Stella.</p>
				<p>He was too jealous of Alan’s absence that evening to want to hear Maurice’s facile enthusiasm.</p>
