				</hgroup>
				<p>In the Upper Fourth class, under the tutorship of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Macrae, Michael began to prosecute seriously the study of Greek, whose alphabet he had learnt the preceding term. He now abandoned the scarlet book of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Elementary Latin</i> for Henry’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Latin Primer</i>, which began with “Balbus was building a wall,” and looked difficult in its mulberry-cloth binding. This term in the Upper Fourth was very trying to Michael. Troubles accumulated. Coincident with the appearance of Greek irregular verbs came the appearance of Avery, a new boy who at once, new boy though he was, assumed command of the Upper Fourth and made Michael the target for his volatile and stinging shafts. Misfortune having once directed her attention to Michael, pursued him for some time to come. Michael was already sufficiently in awe of Avery’s talent for hurting his feelings, when from the Hebrides <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane sent down Harris tweed for Michael’s Norfolk suits. He begged Miss Carthew to let him continue in the inconspicuous dark blue serge which was the fashion at Randell’s; but for once she was unsympathetic, and Michael had to wear the tweed. Avery, of course, was very witty at his expense and for a long time Michael was known as “strawberry-bags,” until the joke palled. Michael had barely lived down the Harris tweed, when Avery discovered, while they were changing into football shorts, that Michael wore combinations instead of pants and vest. Combinations were held to be the depth of effeminacy, and Avery often enquired when Michael was going to appear in petticoats and stays. Michael spoke to Miss Carthew about these combinations which at the very moment of purchase he had feared, but Miss Carthew insisted that they were much healthier than the modish pants and vest, and Michael was not allowed to change the style of his underclothing. In desperation he tied some tape round his waist, but the observant Avery noticed this ruse, and Michael was more cruelly teazed than ever. Then one Monday morning the worst blow of all fell suddenly. The boys at Randell’s had on Saturday morning to take down from dictation the form-list in a home-book, which had to be brought back on Monday morning signed by a parent, so that no boy should escape the vigilance of the paternal eye. Of course, Miss Carthew always signed Michael’s home-book and so far no master had asked any questions. But <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Macrae said quite loudly on this Monday morning:</p>
				<p>“Who is this Maud Carthew that signs your book, Fane?”</p>
				<p>Michael felt the pricking of the form’s ears and blushed hotly.</p>
				<p>“My mother’s away,” he stammered.</p>
				<p>“Oh,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Macrae bluntly, “and who is this person then?”</p>
				<p>Michael nearly choked with shame.</p>
				<p>“My governess⁠—my sister’s governess, I mean,” he added, desperately trying to retrieve the situation.</p>
				<p>“Oh, yes,” said <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Macrae. “I see.”</p>
				<p>The form tittered, while the crimson Michael stumbled back to his desk. It was a long time before Avery grew tired of Miss Carthew or before the class wearied of crying “Maudie” in an united falsetto whenever Michael ventured to speak. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Macrae, too, made cruel use of his advantage, for whenever Michael tripped over an irregular verb, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Macrae would address to the ceiling in his soft unpleasant voice sarcastic remarks about governesses, while every Monday morning he would make a point of putting on his glasses to examine Michael’s home-book very carefully. The climax of Michael’s discomfort was reached, when a snub-nosed boy called Jubb with a cockney accent asked him what his father was.</p>
				<p>“He’s dead,” Michael answered.</p>
				<p>“Yes, but what was he?” Jubb persisted.</p>
				<p>“He was a gentleman,” said Michael.</p>
				<p>Avery happened to overhear this and was extremely witty over Michael’s cockiness, so witty that Michael was goaded into retaliation, notwithstanding his fear of Avery’s tongue.</p>
				<p>“Well, what is your father?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“My father’s a duke, and I’ve got an uncle who’s a millionaire, and my governess is a queen,” said Avery.</p>
				<p>Michael was silent: he could not contend with Avery. Altogether the Upper Fourth was a very unpleasant class; but next term Michael and half of the class were moved up to the Lower Fifth, and Avery left to go to a private school in Surrey, because he was ultimately destined for Charterhouse, near which school his people had, as he said, taken a large house. Curiously enough the combination of half the Upper Fourth with the half of the Lower Fifth left behind made a rather pleasant class, one that Michael enjoyed as much as any other so far, particularly as he was beginning to find that he was clever enough to avoid doing as much schoolwork as hitherto he had done, without in any way permanently jeopardizing his position near the top of the form. To be sure <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wagstaff, the cherub-faced master of the Lower Fifth, complained of his continually shifting position from one end of the class to the other; but Michael justified himself and incidentally somewhat annoyed <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Wagstaff by coming out head boy in the Christmas examinations. Meanwhile, if he found Greek irregular verbs and Latin gender rhymes tiresome, Michael read unceasingly at home, preferably books that encouraged the private schoolboy’s instinct to take sides. Michael was for the Trojans against the Greeks, partly on account of the Greek verbs, but principally because he once had a straw hat inscribed <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">H.M.S.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hector</i>. He was also for the Lancastrians against the Yorkists, and, of course, for the Jacobites against the Hanoverians. Somewhat illogically, he was for the Americans against the English, because as Miss Carthew pointed out he was English himself and the English were beaten. She used to teaze Michael for nearly always choosing the beaten side. She also used to annoy him by her assertion that in taking the part of the Americans in the War of Independence, he showed that most of his other choices were only due to the books he read. She used to make him very angry by saying that he was at heart a Roundhead and a Whig, and even hinted that he would grow up a Radical. This last insinuation really annoyed him very much indeed, because at Randell House no boy could be anything but a Conservative without laying himself open to the suggestion that he was not a gentleman.</p>
				<p>In time, after an absence of nearly two years, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane came home for a long time; but Michael did not feel any of those violent emotions of joy that once he used to feel when he saw her cab rounding the corner. He was shy of his mother, and she for her part seemed shy of him and told Miss Carthew that school had not improved Michael. She wondered, too, why he always seemed anxious to be playing with other boys.</p>
				<p>“It’s quite natural,” Miss Carthew pointed out.</p>
				<p>“Darling Michael. I suppose it is,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane agreed vaguely. “But he’s so grubby and inky nowadays.”</p>
				<p>Michael maintained somewhat indignantly that all the boys at Randell’s were like him, for he was proud that by being grubby and inky no boy could detect in him any inclination to differentiate himself from the mass. At Randell’s, where there was one way only of thinking and behaving and speaking, it would have been grossly cocky to be brushed and clean. Michael resented his mother’s attempt to dress him nicely and was almost rude when she suggested ideas for charming and becoming costumes.</p>
				<p>“I do think boys are funny,” she used to sigh.</p>
				<p>“Well, mother,” Michael would argue, “if I wore a suit like that, all the other boys would notice it.”</p>
				<p>“But I think it’s nice to be noticed,” <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane would contend.</p>
				<p>“I think it’s beastly,” Michael always said.</p>
				<p>“I wish you wouldn’t use that horrid word,” his mother would say disapprovingly.</p>
				<p>“All the boys do,” was Michael’s invariable last word.</p>
				<p>Then, “Michael,” Miss Carthew would say sharply, as she fixed him with that cold look which he so much dreaded. Michael would blush and turn away, abashed; while Stella’s company would be demanded by his mother instead of his, and Stella would come into the room all lily-rosed beside her imp-like brother.</p>
				<p>Stella was held by Michael to be affected, and he would often point out to her how little such behaviour would be tolerated at a boys’ school. Stella’s usual reply was to pout, a form of expression which came under the category of affectations, or she would cry, which was a degree worse and was considered to be as good as sneaking outright. Michael often said he hoped that school would improve Stella’s character and behaviour; yet when she went to school, Michael thought that not only was she none the better for the experience, but he was even inclined to suggest that she was very much the worse. Tiresome little girl friends came to tea sometimes and altered Michael’s arrangements; and when they came they used to giggle in corners and Stella used to show off detestably. Once Michael was so much vexed by a certain Dorothy that he kissed her spitefully, and a commotion ensued from the middle of which rose Miss Carthew, grey-eyed and august like Pallas Athene in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Heroes</i>. It seemed to Michael that altogether too much importance was attached to this incident. He had merely kissed Dorothy in order to show his contempt for her behaviour. One would think from the lecture given by Miss Carthew that it was pleasant to kiss giggling little girls. Michael felt thoroughly injured by the imputation of gallantry, and sulked instead of giving reasons.</p>
				<p>“I really think your mother is right,” Miss Carthew said at last. “You are quite different from the old Michael.”</p>
				<p>“I didn’t want to kiss her,” he cried, exasperated.</p>
				<p>“Doesn’t that make it all the worse?” Miss Carthew suggested.</p>
				<p>Michael shrugged his shoulders feeling powerless to contend with all this stupidity of opinion.</p>
				<p>“Surely,” said Miss Carthew at last, “Don Quixote or General Mace or Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> wouldn’t have kissed people against their will in order to be spiteful.”</p>
				<p>“They might,” argued Michael; “if rotten little girls came to tea and made them angry.”</p>
				<p>“I will not have that word ‘rotten’ used in front of me,” Miss Carthew said.</p>
				<p>“Well, fatheaded then,” Michael proposed as a euphemism.</p>
				<p>“The truth is,” Miss Carthew pointed out, “you were angry because you couldn’t have the Macalisters to tea and you vented your anger on poor Stella and her friends. I call it mean and unchivalrous.”</p>
				<p>“Well, Stella goes to mother and asks for Dorothy to come to tea, when you told me I could have the Macalisters, and I don’t see why I should always have to give way.”</p>
				<p>“Boys always give way to girls,” generalized Miss Carthew.</p>
				<p>“I don’t believe they do nowadays,” said Michael.</p>
				<p>“I see it’s hopeless to argue any more. I’m sorry you won’t see you’re in the wrong. It makes me feel disappointed.”</p>
				<p>Michael again shrugged his shoulders.</p>
				<p>“I don’t see how I can possibly ask your mother to let Nancy stay here next Christmas. I suppose you’ll be trying to kiss her.”</p>
				<p>Michael really had to laugh at this.</p>
				<p>“Why, I like Nancy awfully,” he said. “And we both think kissing is fearful rot⁠—I mean frightfully stupid. But I won’t do it again, Miss Carthew. I’m sorry. I am really.”</p>
				<p>There was one great advantage in dealing with Miss Carthew. She was always ready to forgive at once, and, as Michael respected her enough to dislike annoying her, he found it perfectly easy to apologize and be friends⁠—particularly as he had set his heart on Nancy’s Christmas visit.</p>
				<p>Carlington Road and the Confederate Roads were now under the control of Michael and his friends. Rodber had gone away to a public school: the elder Macalister and Garrod had both got bicycles which occupied all their time: Michael, the twin Macalisters and a boy called Norton were in a very strong position of authority. Norton had two young brothers and the Macalisters had one, so that there were three slaves in perpetual attendance. It became the fashion to forsake the school field for the more adventurous wasteland of the neighbourhood. At the end of Carlington Road itself still existed what was practically open country as far as it lasted. There were elm-trees and declivities and broken hedges and the excavated hollows of deserted gravel-pits. There was an attractive zigzag boundary fence which was sufficiently ruinous at certain intervals to let a boy through to wander in the allotments of railway workers. Bands of predatory “cads” prowled about this wasteland, and many were the fierce fights at sundown between the cads and the Randellites. Caps were taken for scalps, and Miss Carthew was horrified to observe nailed to Michael’s bedroom wall the filthiest cap she had ever seen.</p>
				<p>Apart from the battles there were the luxurious camps, where cigarettes at five a penny were smoked to the last puff and were succeeded by the consumption of highly scented sweets to remove the traces of tobacco. These camps were mostly pitched in the gravelly hollows, where Michael and the Macalisters and Norton used to sit round a campfire on the warm evenings of summer, while silhouetted against the blue sky above stood the minor Macalister and the junior Nortons in ceaseless vigilance. The bait held out to these sentries, who sometimes mutinied, was their equipment with swords, guns, pistols, shields, bows, arrows and breastplates. So heavily and decoratively armed and sustained by the prospect of peppermint bull’s-eyes, Dicky Macalister and the two Nortons were content for an hour to scan the horizon for marauding cads, while down below the older boys discussed life in all its ambiguity and complication. These symposiums in the gravel-pit tried to solve certain problems in a very speculative manner.</p>
				<p>“There must be <em>some</em> secret about being married,” said Michael one Saturday afternoon, when the sun blazed down upon the sentries and the last cigarette had been smoked.</p>
				<p>“There <em>is</em>,” Norton agreed,</p>
				<p>“I can’t make out about twins,” Michael continued, looking critically at the Macalisters.</p>
				<p>Siegfried Macalister, generally known as “Smack” in distinction to his brother Hugh always called “Mac,” felt bound to offer a suggestion.</p>
				<p>“There’s twenty minutes’ difference between us. I heard my mater tell a visitor, and besides I’m the eldest.”</p>
				<p>Speculation was temporarily interrupted by a bout between Smack and Mac, because neither was allowed to claim priority. At the end of an indecisive round Michael struck in:</p>
				<p>“But why are there twins? People don’t like twins coming, because in <i epub:type="se:name.publication">Ally Sloper</i> there’s always a joke about twins.”</p>
				<p>“I know married people who haven’t got any children at all,” said Norton in order still more elaborately to complicate the point at issue.</p>
				<p>“Yes, there you are,” said Michael. “There’s some secret about marriage.”</p>
				<p>“There’s a book in my mater’s room which I believe would tell us,” hinted Smack.</p>
				<p>“There’s a good deal in the Bible,” Norton observed. “Only it’s difficult to find the places and then you can’t tell for certain what they mean.”</p>
				<p>Then came a long whispering at the end of which the four boys shook their heads very wisely and said that they were sure that was it.</p>
				<p>“Hullo!” Michael shouted, forgetting the debate. “Young Dicky’s signalling.”</p>
				<p>“Indians,” said Mac.</p>
				<p>“Sioux or Apaches?” asked Smack anxiously.</p>
				<p>“Neither. It’s Arabs. Charge,” shouted Norton.</p>
				<p>All problems went to the winds in the glories of action, in the clash of stick on stick, in the rending of cad’s collar and cad’s belt, and in the final defeat of the Arabs with the loss of their caravan⁠—a sugar-box on a pair of elliptical wheels.</p>
				<p>In addition to the arduous military life led by Michael at this period, he was also in common with Smack and Mac and Norton a multiplex collector. At first the two principal collections were silkworms and silver-paper. Afterwards came postage stamps and coins and medals and autographs and birds’ eggs and shells and fossils and bones and skins and butterflies and moths and portraits of famous cricketers. From the moment the first silkworm was brought home in a perforated cardboard-box to the moment when by some arrangement of vendible material the first bicycle was secured, the greater part of Michael’s leisure was mysteriously occupied in swapping. This swapping would continue until the mere theory of swapping for swapping’s sake as exemplified in a paper called <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Exchange and Mart</i> was enough. When this journal became the rage, the most delightful occupation of Michael and his friends was that of poring over the columns of this medium of barter in order to read of <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">X. Y. Z.</abbr> in Northumberland who was willing to exchange five Buff Orpingtons, a suit, a tennis racket and Cowper’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Poems</i> for a mechanical organ or a 5 <abbr>ft.</abbr> by 4 <abbr>ft.</abbr> greenhouse. All the romance of commerce was to be found in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Exchange and Mart</i> together with practical hints on the moulting of canaries or red mange in collies. Cricket was in the same way made a mathematical abstraction of decimals and initials and averages and records. All sorts of periodicals were taken in⁠—<i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Cricket</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">The Cricketer</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Cricketing</i> amongst many others. From an exact perusal of these, Michael and the Macalisters knew that Streatham could beat Hampstead and were convinced of the superiority of the Incogniti <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">C.C.</abbr> over the Stoics <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism" class="eoc">C.C.</abbr> With the collections of cricketers’ portraits some of these figures acquired a conceivable personality; but, for the most part, they remained <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">L. M. N. O. P. Q.</abbr> Smith representing 36·58 an innings and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R. S. T. U. V. W.</abbr> Brown costing 11·07 a wicket. That they wore moustaches, lived and loved like passionate humanity did not seem to matter compared with the arithmetical progression of their averages. When Michael and Norton (who was staying with him at <abbr>St.</abbr> Leonards) were given shillings and told to see the Hastings’ Cricket Week from the bowling of the first ball to the drawing of the final stump, Michael and Norton were very much bored indeed, and deprecated the waste of time in watching real cricket, when they might have been better occupied in collating the weekly cricketing journals.</p>
				<p>At Christmas Michael emerged from a successful autumn term with Stories from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Odyssey</i> by Professor Church and a chestnut that was reputed to have conquered nine hundred and sixty-six other and softer chestnuts. That nine hundred and sixty-sixer of Michael’s was a famous nut, and the final struggle between it (then a five hundred and forty-oner) and the four hundred and twenty-fourer it smashed was a contest long talked of in circles where Conquerors were played. Michael much regretted that the etiquette of the Lent term, which substituted peg-tops for Conquerors, should prevent his chestnut reaching four figures. He knew that next autumn term, if all fell out as planned, he would be at <abbr>St.</abbr> James’ School itself, where Conquerors and tops and marbles were never even mentioned, save as vanities and toys of early youth. However, he swapped the nine hundred and sixty-sixer for seven white mice and a slowworm in spirits of wine belonging to Norton; and he had the satisfaction of hearing later on that after a year in rejuvenating oil the nine hundred and sixty-sixer became a two thousand and thirty-threer before it fell down a drain, undefeated.</p>
				<p>After Christmas Nancy Carthew came up from Hampshire to spend a fortnight at Carlington Road, and the holidays were spent in a fever of theatres and monuments and abbeys. Michael asked Nancy what she thought of Stella and her affectation, and was surprised by Nancy saying she thought Stella was an awfully jolly kid and “no end good” at the piano. Michael in consideration of Nancy’s encomium tried to take a fresh view of Stella and was able sincerely to admit that, compared with many other little girls of the neighbourhood, Stella was fairly pretty. He decided that it would be a good thing for Norton to marry her. He told Norton that there seemed no reason why he and Stella should not come together in affection, and Norton said that, if Michael thought he should, he was perfectly willing to marry Stella, when he was grown up. Michael thereupon swapped a box of somewhat bent dragoons for a ring, and presented this ring to Norton with the injunction that he should on no account tell Stella that he was engaged to her, in case it made her cocky. He also forbade Norton to kiss her (not that he supposed Norton wanted to kiss Stella), because Miss Carthew would be annoyed and might possibly close the area door to Norton for the future.</p>
				<p>When Nancy went back to Hampshire, Michael felt lonely. The Macalisters and the Nortons had gone away on visits, and Carlington Road was dreary without them. Michael read a great deal and by reason of being at home he gradually became less grubby, as the holidays wore on. Also his hair grew long and waved over his forehead with golden lights and shadows and curled in bunches by his ears. A new Eton suit well became him, and his mother said how charming he looked. Michael deplored good looks in boys, but he managed to endure the possession of them during the little space that remained before the Lent term began. He took to frequenting the drawing-room again as of old and, being nowadays allowed to stay up till a quarter to nine, he used to spend a rosy half-hour after dinner sitting on a footstool in the firelight by his mother’s knee. She used to stroke his hair and sigh sometimes, when she looked at him.</p>
				<p>One afternoon just before term began <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane told him to make himself as tidy as possible, because she wanted to take him out to pay a call. Michael was excited by this notion, especially when he heard that they were to travel by hansom, a form of vehicle which he greatly admired. The hansom bowled along the Kensington Road with Michael in his Eton suit and top-hat sitting beside his mother scented sweetly with delicious perfumes and very silky to the touch. They drove past Kensington Gardens all dripping with January rains, past Hyde Park and the Albert Memorial, past the barracks of the Household Cavalry, past Hyde Park Corner and the Duke of Wellington’s house. They dashed along with a jingle and a rattle over the slow old omnibus route, and Michael felt very much distinguished as he turned round to look at the melancholy people crammed inside each omnibus they passed. When they came to Devonshire House, they turned round to the left and pulled up before a grand house in a square. Michael pressed the bell, and the door opened immediately, much more quickly than he had ever known a door open.</p>
				<p>“Is his lordship in?” asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane.</p>
				<p>“His lordship is upstairs, ma’am,” said the footman.</p>
				<p>The hall seemed full of footmen, one of whom took Michael’s hat and another of whom led the way up a wide soft staircase that smelt like the inside of the South Kensington Museum. All the way up, the walls were hung with enormous pictures of men in white wigs. Presently they stood in the largest room Michael had ever entered, a still white room full of golden furniture. Michael had barely recovered his breath from astonishment at the size of the room, when he saw another room round the corner, in which a man was sitting by a great fire. When the footman had left the room very quietly, this man got up and held <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane’s hand for nearly a minute. Then he looked at Michael, curiously, Michael thought, so curiously as to make him blush.</p>
				<p>“And this is the boy?” the gentleman asked.</p>
				<p>Michael thought his mother spoke very funnily, as if she were just going to cry, when she answered:</p>
				<p>“Yes, this is Michael.”</p>
				<p>“My God, Valérie,” said the man, “it makes it harder than ever.”</p>
				<p>Michael took the opportunity to look at this odd man and tried to think where he had seen him before. He was sure he had seen him somewhere. But every time just as he had almost remembered, a mist came over the picture he was trying to form, so that he could not remember.</p>
				<p>“Well, Michael,” said the gentleman, “you don’t know who I am.”</p>
				<p>“Ah, don’t, Charles,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane.</p>
				<p>“Well, he’s not so wise as all that,” laughed the gentleman.</p>
				<p>Michael thought it was a funny laugh, more sad than cheerful.</p>
				<p>“This is Lord Saxby,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane.</p>
				<p>“I say, my name is Saxby,” Michael exclaimed.</p>
				<p>“Nonsense,” said Lord Saxby, “I don’t believe it.”</p>
				<p>“It is really. Charles Michael Saxby Fane.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that’s a very strange thing,” said Lord Saxby.</p>
				<p>“Yes, I think it’s awfully funny,” Michael agreed. “Because I never heard of anyone called Saxby. My name’s Charles too. Only, of course, that’s quite a common name. But nobody at our school knows I’m called Saxby except a boy called Buckley who’s an awful beast. We don’t tell our Christian names, you know. If a chap lets out his Christian name he gets most frightfully ragged by the other chaps. Chaps think you’re an awfully silly ass if you let out your Christian name.”</p>
				<p>Michael was finding it very easy to talk.</p>
				<p>“I must hear some more about this wonderful school,” Lord Saxby declared.</p>
				<p>Then followed a delightful conversation in which due justice was done to the Macalister twins and to Norton, and to the life they shared with Michael.</p>
				<p>“By gad, Valérie, he ought to go to Eton, you know,” declared Lord Saxby, turning to Michael’s mother.</p>
				<p>“No, no. I’m sure you were right, when you said <abbr>St.</abbr> James’,” persisted <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane.</p>
				<p>“Perhaps I was,” Lord Saxby sighed. “Well, Valérie⁠—not again. It’s too damnably tantalizing.”</p>
				<p>“I thought just once while he was still small,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Fane softly. “Photographs are so unsatisfactory. And you haven’t yet heard Stella play.”</p>
				<p>“Valérie, I couldn’t. Look at this great barrack of a house. If you only knew how I long sometimes for⁠—what a muddle it all is!”</p>
				<p>Then a footman came in with tea, and Michael wondered what dinner was like in this house, if mere tea were so grand and silvery.</p>
				<p>“I think I must drive you back in the phaeton,” said Lord Saxby.</p>
				<p>“No, no, Charles. No more rules must be broken.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, I suppose you’re right. But don’t⁠—not again, please. I can’t bear to think of the ‘ifs.’ ”</p>
				<p>Then Lord Saxby turned to Michael.</p>
				<p>“Look here, young man, what do you want most?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, boxes of soldiers and an unused set of Siamese,” said Michael.</p>
				<p>“Siamese what? Siamese cats?”</p>
				<p>“No, you silly,” laughed Michael, “Stamps, of course!”</p>
				<p>“Oh, stamps,” said Lord Saxby. “Right⁠—and soldiers, eh? Good.”</p>
				<p>All the way back in the hansom Michael wished he had specified Artillery to Lord Saxby; but two days afterwards dozens of boxes of all kinds of soldiers arrived, and unused sets not merely of Siamese, but of North American Tercentenaries and Borneos and Labuans and many others.</p>
				<p>“I say,” Michael gasped, “he’s a ripper, isn’t he? What spiffing boxes! I say, he is a decent chap, isn’t he? When are we going to see Lord Saxby again, mother?”</p>
				<p>“Some day.”</p>
				<p>“I can have Norton to tea on Wednesday, can’t I?” begged Michael. “He’ll think my soldiers are awfully ripping.”</p>
				<p>“Darling Michael,” said his mother.</p>
				<p>“Mother, I will try and not be inky,” said Michael in a burst of affectionate renunciation.</p>
				<p>“Dearest boy,” said his mother gently.</p>
