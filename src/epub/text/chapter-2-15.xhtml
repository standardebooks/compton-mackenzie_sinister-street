				<p epub:type="title">Grey Eyes</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>As Michael sat opposite to his mother in the railway-carriage on the following morning, he found it hard indeed to realize that an ocean did not stretch between them. He did not feel ashamed; he had no tremors for the straightforward regard; he had no uneasy sensation that possibly even now his mother was perplexing herself on account of his action. He simply felt that he had suffered a profound change and that his action of yesterday called for a readjustment of his entire standpoint. Or rather, he felt that having since yesterday travelled so far and lived so violently, he could now only meet his mother as a friend from whom one has been long parted and whose mental progress during many years must be gradually apprehended.</p>
			<p>“Why do you look at me with such a puzzled expression, Michael?” asked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane. “Is my hat crooked?”</p>
			<p>Michael assured her that nothing was the matter with her hat.</p>
			<p>“Do you want to ask me something?” persisted <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane.</p>
			<p>Michael shook his head and smiled, wondering whether he did really wish to ask her a question, whether he would be relieved to know what attitude she would adopt towards his adventure. With so stirring a word did he enhance what otherwise would have seemed base. His mother evidently was aware of a tension in this ridiculously circumscribed railway-carriage. Would it be released if he were to inform her frankly of what had happened, or would such, an admission be an indiscretion from which their relationship would never recover? After all she was his mother, and there must positively exist in her inmost self the power of understanding what he had done. Some part of the impulse which had actuated his behaviour would surely find a root in the heart of the handsome woman who travelled with such becoming repose on the seat opposite to him. He forgot to bother about himself in this sudden new pleasure of observation that seemed to endow him with undreamed-of opportunities of distraction and, what was more important, with a stable sense of his own individuality. How young his mother looked! Until now he had taken her youth for granted, but she must be nearly forty. It was scarcely credible that this tall slim creature with the proud, upcurving mouth and lustrous grey eyes was his own mother. He thought of his friends’ homes that were presided over by dumpy women in black silk with greying hair. Even Alan’s mother, astonishingly pretty though she was, seemed in the picture he conjured of her to look faded beside his own.</p>
			<p>And while he was pondering his mother’s beauty, the train reached the station at which they must alight for Basingstead. There was Alan in white flannels on the platform, there too was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross; and as she greeted his mother Michael’s thoughts went back to the day he saw these two come together at Carlington Road, and by their gracious encounter drive away the shadow of Nurse.</p>
			<p>“I vote we walk,” said Alan. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane and Aunt Maud can drive in the pony-chaise, and then your luggage can all come up at once in the cart.”</p>
			<p>So it was arranged, and as Michael watched his mother and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross drive off, he was strangely reminded of a picture that he had once dearly loved, a picture by Flaxman of Hera and Athene driving down from Olympus to help the Greeks. <i xml:lang="el">Λευκὡλενος Ἡρη</i>⁠—that was his mother, and <i xml:lang="el">γλαυκὡπις Ἁθἡνη</i>⁠—that was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross. He could actually remember the line in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i> that told of the gates of heaven, where the Hours keep watch, opening for the goddesses’ descent⁠—<i xml:lang="el">αὑτὑμαται δἑ πὑλαι μὑκοον οὑρανοι ἁς ἑχον Ὡραι</i>. At the same time for all his high quotations, Michael could not help smiling at the dolefully senescent dun pony being compared to the golden steeds of Hera or at the pleasant old porter who hastened to throw open the white gate of the station-drive serving as a substitute for the Hours.</p>
			<p>The country air was still sweet between the hazel hedgerows, although the grass was drouthy and the scabious blooms were already grey with dust. Nothing for Michael could have been more charged with immemorial perfume than this long walk at July’s end. It held the very quintessence of holiday airs through all the marching years of boyhood. It was haunted by the memory of all the glad anticipations of six weeks’ freedom that time after time had succeeded the turmoil of breaking up for the August holidays. The yellow amoret swinging from the tallest shoot of the hedge was the companion of how many summer walks. The acrid smell of nettles by the roadside was prophetic of how many pastoral days. The butterflies, brown and white and tortoiseshell, that danced away to right and left over the green bushes, to what winding paths did they not summon. And surely Alan gave a final grace to this first walk of the holidays. Surely he crystallized all hopes, all memories, all delights of the past in a perfection of present joy.</p>
			<p>Yet Michael, as he walked beside him, could only think of Alan as a beautiful inanimate object for whom perception did not exist. Inanimate, however, was scarcely the word to describe one who was so very definitely alive: Michael racked his invention to discover a suitable label for Alan, but he could not find the word. With a shock of misgiving he asked himself whether he had outgrown their friendship, and partly to test, but chiefly to allay his dread, he took Alan’s arm with a gesture of almost fierce possession. He was relieved to find that Alan’s touch was still primed with consolation, that companionship with him still soothed the turbulence of his own spirit reaching out to grasp what could never be expressed in words, and therefore could never be grasped. Michael was seized with a longing to urge Alan to grow up more quickly, to make haste lest he should be left behind by his adventurous friend. Michael remembered how he used to dread being moved up, hating to leave Alan in a class below him, how he had deliberately dallied to allow Alan to overtake him. But idleness in schoolwork was not the same as idleness in experience of life, and unless Alan would quickly grow up, he knew that he must soon leave him irremediably behind. It was distressing to reflect that Alan would be shocked by the confidence which he longed to impose upon him, and it was disquieting to realize that these last summer holidays of school, however complete with the quiet contentment of familiar pleasures, would for himself grow slowly irksome with deferred excitement.</p>
			<p>But as the green miles slowly unfolded themselves, as the dauntless yellow amoret still swung from a lissome stem, as Alan spoke of the river and the grey tower on the hill, Michael saw the fretful colours of the Exhibition grow dim; and when dreaming in the haze of the slumberous afternoon they perceived the village and heard the mysterious murmur of human tranquillity, Michael’s heart overflowed with gratitude for the sight of Alan by his side. Then the church-clock that struck a timeless hour sounded for him one of those moments whose significance would resist eternally whatever lying experience should endeavour to assail the truth which had made of one flashing scene a revelation.</p>
			<p>Michael was ineffably refreshed by his vision of the imperishable substance of human friendship, and he could not but jeer at himself now for having a little while back put Alan into the domain of objects inanimate.</p>
			<p>“There’s your cottage,” said Alan. “It’s practically next door to Cobble Place. Rather decent, eh?”</p>
			<p>Michael could not say how decent he thought it, nor how decent he thought Alan.</p>
			<p>“I vote we go up the river after tea,” he suggested.</p>
			<p>“Rather,” said Alan. “I expect you’ll come round to tea with us. Don’t be long unpacking.”</p>
			<p>“I shan’t, you bet,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>Nor was he, and after a few minutes he and his mother were sitting in the drawing-room at Cobble Place, eating a tea that must have been very nearly the same as an unforgettable tea of nine years ago. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew did not seem quite so old; nor indeed did anybody, and as for Joan and May Carthew, they were still girls. Yet even when he and Alan had stayed down here for the wedding only four years ago, Michael had always been conscious of everybody’s age. And now he was curiously aware of everybody’s youth. He supposed vaguely that all this change of outlook was due to his own remarkable precocity and rapid advance; but nevertheless he still ate with all the heartiness of childhood.</p>
			<p>After tea <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross with much tact took up Michael by himself to see her son and, spared the necessity of comment, Michael solemnly regarded the fair-haired boy of two who was squeaking an india-rubber horse for his mother’s benefit.</p>
			<p>“O you attractive son of mine,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross sighed in a whisper.</p>
			<p>“He’s an awfully sporting kid,” Michael said.</p>
			<p>Then he suddenly remembered that he had not seen <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross since her husband was killed. Yet from this chintz-hung room whose casements were flooded with the amber of the westering sun, how far off seemed fatal Africa. He remembered also that to this very same gay room he had long ago gone with Miss Carthew after tea, that here in a ribboned bed he had first heard the news of her coming to live at 64 Carlington Road.</p>
			<p>“We must have a long talk together soon,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross, seeming to divine his thoughts. “But I expect you’re anxious to revive old memories and visit old haunts with Alan. I’m going to stay here and talk to Kenneth while Nurse has her tea.”</p>
			<p>Michael lingered for a moment in the doorway to watch the two. Then he said abruptly, breathlessly:</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross, I think painters and sculptors are lucky fellows. I’d like to paint you now. I wish one could understand the way people look, when one’s young. But I’m just beginning to realize how lucky I was when you came to us. And yet I used to be ashamed of having a governess. Still, I believe I did appreciate you, even when I was eight.”</p>
			<p>Then he fled, and to cover his retreat sang out loudly for Alan all the way downstairs.</p>
			<p>“I say, Aunt Enid wants to talk to you,” said Alan.</p>
			<p>“Aunt Enid?” Michael echoed.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew,” Alan explained.</p>
			<p>“I vote we go for a walk afterwards, don’t you?” Michael suggested.</p>
			<p>“Rather,” said Alan. “I’ll shout for you, when I think you’ve jawed long enough.”</p>
			<p>Michael found <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew in her sun-coloured garden, cutting down the withering lupins whose silky seedpods were strewn all about the paths.</p>
			<p>“Can you spare ten minutes for an old friend?” asked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew.</p>
			<p>Michael thought how tremendously wise she looked, and lest he should be held to be staring unduly, he bent down to sweep together the shimmering seedpods, while <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew snipped away, talking in sentences that matched the quick snickasnack of her weapon.</p>
			<p>“I must say you’ve grown up into an attractive youth. Let me see, you must be seventeen and a half. I suppose you think yourself a man now? Dear me, these lupins should have been cut back a fortnight ago. And now I have destroyed a hollyhock. Tut-tut, I’m getting very blind. What did you think of Maud’s son? A healthy rosy child, and not at all amenable to discipline, I’m glad to say. Well, are you enjoying school?”</p>
			<p>The old lady paused with her scissors gaping, and looked shrewdly at Michael.</p>
			<p>“I’m getting rather fed up with it,” Michael admitted. “It goes on for such a long time. It wasn’t so bad this term, though.”</p>
			<p>Then he remembered that whatever pleasures had mitigated the exasperation of school last term were decidedly unscholastic, and he blushed.</p>
			<p>“I simply loathed it for a time,” he added.</p>
			<p>“Alan informs me he acquired his first eleven cap this term and will be in the first fifteen as Lord Treasurer or something,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew went on. “Naturally he must enjoy this shower of honours. Alan is decidedly typical of the better class of unthinking young Englishman. He is pleasant to look at⁠—a little colt-like perhaps, but that will soon wear off. My own dear boy was very like him, and Maud’s dear husband was much the same. You, I’m afraid, think too much, Michael.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no, I don’t think very much,” said Michael, disclaiming philosophy, and greatly afraid that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew was supposing him a prig.</p>
			<p>“You needn’t be ashamed of thinking,” she said. “After all, the amount you think now won’t seriously disorganize the world. But you seem to me old for your age, much older than Alan for instance, and though your conversation with me at any rate is not mature, nevertheless you convey somehow an impression of maturity that I cannot quite account for.”</p>
			<p>Michael could not understand why, when for the first time he was confronted with somebody who gave his precocity its due, he was unable to discuss it eagerly and voluminously, why he should half resent being considered older than Alan.</p>
			<p>“Don’t look so cross with me,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew commanded. “I am an old woman, and I have a perfect right to say what I please to you. Besides, you and I have had many conversations, and I take a great interest in you. What are you going to be?”</p>
			<p>“Well, that’s what I can’t find out,” said Michael desperately. “I know what I’m not going to be, and that’s all.”</p>
			<p>“That’s a good deal, I think,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew. “Pray tell me what professions you have condemned.”</p>
			<p>“I’m not going into the Army. I’m not going into the Civil Service. I’m not going to be a doctor or a lawyer.”</p>
			<p>“Or a parson?” asked <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew, crunching through so many lupin stalks at once that they fell with a rattle on to the path.</p>
			<p>“Well, I have thought about being a parson,” Michael slowly granted. “But I don’t think parsons ought to marry.”</p>
			<p>“Good gracious,” exclaimed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew, “you’re surely not engaged?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no,” said Michael; but he felt extremely flattered by the imputation. “Still, I might want to be.”</p>
			<p>“Then you’re in love,” decided <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew. “No wonder you look so careworn. I suppose she’s nearly thirty and has promised to wait until you come of age. I can picture her. If I had my stick with me I could draw her on the gravel. A melon stuck on a bell-glass, I’ll be bound.”</p>
			<p>“I’m not in love, and if I were in love,” said Michael with dignity, “I certainly shouldn’t be in love with anyone like that. But I could be in love at any moment, and so I don’t think I shall be a parson.”</p>
			<p>“You’ve got plenty of time,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew. “Alan says you’re going to Oxford next year.”</p>
			<p>Michael’s heart leapt⁠—next year had never before seemed so imminent.</p>
			<p>“I suppose you’ll say that I’m an ignorant and foolish old woman, if I attempt to give you advice about Oxford; but I gave you advice once about school, and I’ll do the same again. To begin with, I think you’ll find having been to <abbr>St.</abbr> James’ a handicap. I have an old friend, the wife of a don, who assures me that many of the boys who go up from your school suffer at Oxford from their selfish incubation by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Brownjohn. They’re fit for killing too soon. In fact, they have been forced.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, but I saw that for myself,” said Michael. “I had a row with Brownjohn about my future.”</p>
			<p>“How delighted I am to hear that!” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew. “I think that I’ll cut back the delphiniums also. Then you’re not going in for a scholarship?”</p>
			<p>“No,” said Michael. “I don’t want to be hampered, and I think my mother’s got plenty of money. But Alan’s going to get a scholarship.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, that is unfortunately necessary,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew. “Still, Alan is sufficiently typical of the public-school spirit⁠—an odious expression yet always unavoidable⁠—to carry off the burden. If you were poor, I should advise you to buy overcoats. Three smart overcoats are an equipment for a poor man. But I needn’t dwell on social ruses in your case. Remember that going to Oxford is like going to school. Be normal and inconspicuous at first; and when you have established yourself as an utterly undistinguished young creature, you can career into whatever absurdities of thought, action or attire you will. In your first year establish your sanity; in your second year display your charm; and in your third year do whatever you like. Now there is Alan calling, and we’ll leave the paths strewn with these cut stalks as a Memento Mori to the gardener. What a charming woman your mother is. She has that exquisite vagueness which when allied with good breeding is perfectly irresistible, at any rate to a practical and worldly old woman like me. But then I’ve had an immense amount of time in which to tidy up. Pleasant hours to you down here. It’s delightful to hear about the place the sound of boys laughing and shouting.”</p>
			<p>Michael left <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew, rather undecided as to what exactly she thought of him or Alan or anybody else. As he walked over the lawn that went sloping down to the stream, he experienced a revulsion from the interest he took in listening to what people thought about him, and he now began to feel an almost morbid sensitiveness to the opinion of others. This destroyed some of the peace which he had sought and cherished down here in the country. He began to wonder if that wise old lady had been laughing at him, whether all she said had been an implied criticism of his attitude towards existence. Her praise must have been grave irony; her endorsement of his behaviour had been disguised reproof. She really admired Alan, and had only been trying as gently as possible to make him come into line with her nephew. He himself must seem to her eccentric, undignified, a flamboyant sort of creature whom she pitied and whose errors she wished to remedy. Michael was mortified by his retrospect of the conversation, and felt inclined when he saw Alan to make an excuse and retire from his society, until his self-esteem had recovered from the rebuke that had lately been inflicted. Indeed, it called for a great effort on Michael’s part to embark in the canoe with his paragon and sit face to face without betraying the wound that was damaging his own sense of personality.</p>
			<p>“You had a very long jaw with Aunt Enid,” said Alan. “I thought you were never coming. She polished me off in about three minutes.”</p>
			<p>Michael looked darkly at Alan for a moment before he asked with ungracious accentuation what on earth Alan and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew had talked about.</p>
			<p>“She was rather down on me,” said Alan. “I think she must have thought I was putting on side about getting my Eleven.”</p>
			<p>Michael was greatly relieved to hear this, and his brow cleared as he enquired what was wrong.</p>
			<p>“Well, I can’t remember her exact words,” Alan went on. “But she said I must be careful not to grow up into a strong silent Englishman, because their day was done. She practically told me I was rather an ass, and pretended to be fearfully surprised when she heard I was going to try for a scholarship at Oxford. She was squashing slugs all the time she was talking, and I could do nothing but look a bigger fool than ever and count the slugs. I ventured to remark once that most people thought it was a good thing to be keen on games, and she said half the world was composed of fools which accounted for the preponderation⁠—I mean preponderance⁠—of pink on the map. She said it always looked like an advertizement of successful foxhunting. And when I carefully pointed out that I’d never all my life had a chance to hunt, she said ‘More’s the pity,’ I couldn’t make out what she was driving at; so, feeling rather a worm, I shot off as soon as I could. What did she say to you?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, nothing much,” said Michael triumphantly. “She’s a rum old girl, but rather decent.”</p>
			<p>“She’s too clever for me,” said Alan, shaking his head. “It’s like batting to a pro.”</p>
			<p>Then from the complexities of feminine judgment, the conversation glided easily like the canoe towards a discussion of the umpire’s decision last term in giving Alan out <abbr>l.b.w.</abbr> to a ball that pitched at least two feet away from the off stump.</p>
			<p>“It was rotten,” said Alan fervidly.</p>
			<p>“It was putrid,” Michael agreed.</p>
			<p>To avoid the difficulty of a first night in a strange cottage, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane and Michael had supper at Cobble Place; and after a jolly evening spent in looking for pencils to play games that nobody could ever recollect in all their rich perfection of potential incidents, Michael and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane walked with leisurely paces back to Woodbine Cottage through a sweet-savoured moonless night.</p>
			<p>Michael enjoyed the intimate good night beneath so small a roof, and wished that Stella were with them. He lay awake, reading from each in turn of the tower of books he had erected by his bedside to fortify himself against sleeplessness. It was a queer enough mixture⁠—Swinburne, Keats, Matthew Arnold, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Robinson Crusoe</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Half-Hours with the Mystics</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tom Brown’s Schooldays</i>, Daudet’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Sappho</i>, the second volume of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Savoy</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Green Carnation</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Holy Living and Dying</i>; and as each time he changed his mind and took another volume, on the gabled ceiling the monstrous shadow that was himself filled him with a dreadful uncertainty. After an hour or so, he went to sit by the low window, leaning out and seeming to hear the dark world revolve in its course. Stars shook themselves clear from great rustling trees, and were in time enmeshed by others. The waning moon came up behind a rounded hill. A breeze fluttered down the dusty road, and was silent.</p>
			<p>Michael fell to wondering whether he could ever bring himself in tune with these slow progressions of nature, whether he could renounce after one haggard spell of experience the mazy stir of transitory emotions that danced always beyond this dream. An Half-hour with <abbr>St.</abbr> John of the Cross made him ask himself whether this were the dark night of the soul through which he was passing. But he had never travelled yet, nor was he travelling now. He was simply sitting quiescent, allowing himself to be passed. These calm and stately figures of humanity whom he admired in their seclusion had only reached it after long strife. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew had lost a husband and a son, had seen her daughter leave her house as a governess. Joan and May had for many years sunk their hopes in tending their mother. Nancy was away earning money, and would be entitled to retire here one day. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross had endured himself and Stella for several years, had married and lost her husband, and had borne a child. All these had won their timeless repose and their serene uncloying ease. They were not fossils, but perdurable images of stone. And his mother, she was⁠—he stopped his reverie. Of his mother he knew nothing. Outside the dust stirred in the road fretfully; a malaise was in the night air. Michael shivered and went back to bed, and as he turned to blow out his candle he saw above him huge and menacing his own shadow. A cock crowed.</p>
			<p>“Silly ass,” muttered Michael, “he thinks it’s already morning,” and turning over after a dreamless sleep he found it was morning. So he rose and dressed himself serenely for a long sunburnt day.</p>
			<p>On his way up the road to call for Alan he met the postman, who in answer to his enquiries handed him a letter from South Africa stamped all over with mysterious official abbreviations. He took it up to his mother curiously.</p>
			<p>At lunch he asked her about the news from the war.</p>
			<p>“Yes, dear, I had a letter,” she murmured.</p>
			<p>“From Lord Saxby, I suppose?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, dear.”</p>
			<p>“Anything interesting?” Michael persisted.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no, it’s only about marches and not being able to wash properly.”</p>
			<p>“I thought it might be interesting,” Michael speculated.</p>
			<p>“No, dear. It wouldn’t interest you,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Fane in her tone of gentle discouragement.</p>
			<p>“I don’t want to be inquisitive,” said Michael resentfully.</p>
			<p>“No, dear, I’m sure you don’t,” his mother softly agreed.</p>
			<p>The holidays ran their pastoral course of sun and rain, of clouds and winds, until the last week arrived with September in her most majestic mood of flawless halcyon. These were days that more than any hitherto enhanced for Michael the reverence he felt for the household of Cobble Place. These were days when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Carthew stepped wisely along her flowery enclosure, pondering the plums and peaches on the warm walls that in a transcendency of mellow sunlight almost took on the texture of living sunburnt flesh. These were days when Joan and May Carthew went down the village street with great bunches of Michaelmas daisies, of phloxes and Japanese anemones, or sat beneath the mulberry tree, sewing in the bee-drowsed air.</p>
			<p>At the foot of the hill beyond the stream was a straggling wind-frayed apple-orchard, fresh pasturage for lambs in spring, and now in September a jolly haunt for the young son of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross. Here one afternoon, when Alan was away at Basingstead Major playing the last cricket match of the year, Michael plunged down in the grass beside her.</p>
			<p>They sat for a while in silence, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross seemed to Michael to be waiting for him to speak first, as if by her own attitude of mute expectation she could lure him on to express himself more openly than by direct question and shy answer. He felt the air pregnant with confidences, and kept urging himself on to begin the statement and revelation of his character, sure that whatever he desired to ask must be asked now while he was perhaps for the last time liable to this grave woman’s influence, conscious of the security of goodness, envious of the maternity of peace. This grey-eyed woman seemed to sit above him like a proud eagle, careless of homage, never to be caught, never to be tamed, a figure for worship and inspiration. Michael wondered why all the women who awed him had grey eyes. Blue eyes fired his senses, striking sparks and kindling answering flames from his own blue eyes. Brown eyes left him indifferent. But grey eyes absorbed his very being, whether they were lustrous and violet-shaded like his mother’s and Stella’s, or whether, like <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross’s, they were soft as grey seawater that in a moment could change to the iron-bound rocks they were so near.</p>
			<p>Still Michael did not speak, but watched <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross solemnly hand back to the rosy child sitting beside her in the grass the fallen apples that he would always fling from him exuberantly, panting the while at laughter’s highest pitch.</p>
			<p>“I wonder if I ever laughed like that,” said Michael.</p>
			<p>“You were a very serious little boy, when I first knew you,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross told him.</p>
			<p>“I must have been rather depressing,” Michael sighed.</p>
			<p>“No, indeed you were not, dear Michael,” she answered. “You had much too much personality.”</p>
			<p>“Have I now?” Michael asked sharply.</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course you have.”</p>
			<p>“Well, what gives it to me?”</p>
			<p>“Surely personality is something that is born with one. Personality can’t be made,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross.</p>
			<p>“You don’t think experience has got anything to do with it?” Michael pressed.</p>
			<p>“I think experience makes the setting, and according to the experience the personality is perfected or debased, but nothing can destroy personality, not even death,” she murmured, far away for a moment from this orchard.</p>
			<p>“Which would you say had the stronger personality⁠—Alan or I?” asked Michael.</p>
			<p>“I should say you had,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross. “Or at any rate you have a personality that will affect a larger number of people, either favourably or unfavourably.”</p>
			<p>“But Alan influences me more than I influence him,” Michael argued.</p>
			<p>“That may be,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross admitted. “Though I think your influence over Alan is very strong in this way. I think Alan is always very eager to see you at your best, and probably as your friendship goes on he will be more solicitous for you than for himself. I should say that he would be likely to sink himself in you. I wonder if you realize what a passionately loyal soul he is.”</p>
			<p>Michael flushed with pleasure at this appreciation of his friend, and his ambition went flying over to Basingstead Major to inspire Alan to bat his best. Then he burst forth in praise of him; he spoke of his changelessness, his freedom from moods, his candour and toleration and modesty.</p>
			<p>“But the terrible thing is,” said Michael suddenly, “that I always feel that without noticing it I shall one day leave Alan behind.”</p>
			<p>“But when you turn back, you’ll find him just the same, don’t forget; and you may be glad that he did not come with you. You may be glad that from his slowness you can find an indication of the road that I’m sure you yourself will one day try to take. Alan will travel by it all his life. You’ll travel by it ultimately. Alan will never really appreciate its beauty. You will. That will be your recompense for what you suffer before you find it.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross, as if to conceal emotion, turned quickly to romp with her son. Then she looked at Michael:</p>
			<p>“And haven’t you already once or twice left Alan behind?”</p>
			<p>Suddenly to Michael her grey eyes seemed accusing.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I suppose I have,” he granted. “But isn’t that the reason why my personality affects more people than his? You said just now that experience was only the setting, but I’m sure in my case it’s more than a mere setting.”</p>
			<p>And even as he spoke all his experience seemed to cloud his brow, knitting and lining it with perplexed wrinkles.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross, you won’t think me very rude if I say you always remind me of Pallas Athene? You always have, you know. At first it was just a vague outward resemblance, because you’re tall and sort of cool-looking, and I really think your nose is rather Greek, if you don’t mind my saying so.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, Michael,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross smiled. “I think you’re even more unalterable than Alan. I seem to see you as a little boy again, when you talk like that.”</p>
			<p>Michael, however, was too keen on the scent of his comparison to be put off by smiles, and he went on eagerly:</p>
			<p>“Now I realize that you actually are like Athene. You’re one of those people who seem to have sprung into the world fully armed. I can’t imagine that you were ever young.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross laughed outright at this.</p>
			<p>“Wait a minute,” cried Michael. “Or ever old for that matter. And you know all about me. No, you needn’t shake your head like that. Because you do.”</p>
			<p>Young Kenneth was so much roused by Michael’s triumphant asseverations that he began to shout and kick in delighted tune and fling the apples from him with a vigour that he had never yet reached.</p>
			<p>“You know,” Michael continued breathlessly, while the boy on the grass gurgled his endorsement of every word. “You know that I’m old for my age, that I’ve already done things that other chaps at school only whisper about.”</p>
			<p>He stopped suddenly, for the grey eyes had become like rocks, and though the baby still panted ecstatically, there fell a chill.</p>
			<p>“I’m very sorry to hear it,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross.</p>
			<p>“Well, why did you lead me on to confide in you?” said Michael sullenly. “I thought you would sympathize.”</p>
			<p>“Michael, I apologize,” she said, melting. “I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. I dare say⁠—ah, Michael, you see how easily all my shining armour falls to pieces.”</p>
			<p>“Another broken bottle,” Michael muttered.</p>
			<p>He got up abruptly and, though there were tears in his eyes, she could not win him back.</p>
			<p>“Dear old boy, do tell me. Don’t make the mistake of going back into yourself, because I failed you for a moment.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross held out her hand, but Michael walked away.</p>
			<p>“You don’t understand,” he turned to say. “You couldn’t understand. And I don’t want you to be able to understand. You mustn’t think I’m sulking, or being rude, and really I’d rather you didn’t understand. That boy of yours won’t ever want you to understand. I don’t think he’ll ever do anything that isn’t perfectly comprehensible.”</p>
			<p>“Michael,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross, “don’t be so bitter. You’ll be sorry soon.”</p>
			<p>“Soon?” asked Michael fiercely. “Soon? Why soon? What’s going to happen to make me sorry soon? Something is going to happen. I know. I feel it.”</p>
			<p>He fled through the wind-frayed orchard up the hillside. With his back against the tower called Grogg’s Folly he looked over four counties and vowed he would go heedless of everything that stood between him and experience. He would deny himself nothing; he would prove to the hilt everything.</p>
			<p>“I must know,” he wrung out of himself. “Everything that has happened must have happened for some reason. I will believe that. I can’t believe in God, until I can believe in myself. And how can I believe in myself yet?”</p>
			<p>The four counties under September’s munificence mocked him with their calm.</p>
			<p>“I know that all these people at Cobble Place are all right,” he groaned. “I know that, just as I know Virgil is a great poet. But I never knew Virgil was great until I read Swinburne. Oh, I want to be calm and splendid and proud of myself, but I want to understand life while I’m alive. I want to believe in immortality, but in case I never can be convinced of it, I want to be convinced of something. Everything seems to be tumbling down nowadays. What’s so absurd is that nobody can understand anybody else, let alone the universe. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Ross can understand why I like Alan, but she can’t understand why I want love. Viner can understand why I get depressed, but he can’t understand why I can’t be cured immediately. Wilmot could understand why I wanted to read his rotten books, but he can’t understand why the South African War upset me. And so on with everybody. I’m determined to understand everybody,” Michael vowed, “even if I can’t have faith,” he sighed to the four counties.</p>
