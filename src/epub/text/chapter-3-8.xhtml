				</hgroup>
				<p>Roll-calls were not kept at <abbr>St.</abbr> Mary’s with that scrupulousness of outward exterior which, in conjunction with early rising, such a discipline may have been designed primarily to secure. On the morning after the attempted adjustment of Appleby’s behavior, a raw and vaporous November morning, Michael at one minute to eight o’clock ran collarless, unbrushed, unshaven, toward the steps leading up to hall at whose head stood the Dean beside the clerkly recorder of these sorry matutinal appearances. Michael waited long enough to see his name fairly entered in the book, yawned resentfully at the Dean, and started back on the taciturn journey that must culminate in the completion of his toilet. Crossing the gravel space between Cloisters and Cuther’s worldly quad, he met Maurice Avery dressed finally for the day at one minute past eight o’clock. Such a phenomenon provoked him into speech.</p>
				<p>“What on earth.⁠ ⁠… Are you going to London?” he gasped.</p>
				<p>“Rather not. I’m going out to buy a copy of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper"><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.L.G.</abbr></i>”</p>
				<p>Michael shook his head, sighed compassionately, and passed on. Twenty minutes later in Common Room he was contemplating distastefully the kedgeree which with a more hopeful appetite he had ordered on the evening before, when Maurice planked down beside his place the first number of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Oxford Looking-Glass</i>.</p>
				<p>“There’s a misprint on page thirty-seven, line six. It ought to be ‘yet’ not ‘but.’ Otherwise I think it’s a success. Do you mind reading my slashing attack on the policy of the Oxford theater? Or perhaps you’d better begin at the beginning and go right through the whole paper and give me your absolutely frank opinion of it as a whole. Just tell me candidly if you think my Reflections are too individual. I want the effect to be more⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Maurice,” Michael interrupted, “do you like kedgeree?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, very much,” Maurice answered absently. Then he plunged on again. “Also don’t forget to tell me if you think that Guy’s skit is too clever. And if you find any misprints I haven’t noticed, mark them down. We can’t alter them now, of course, but I’ll speak to the compositor myself. You like the color? I wonder whether it wouldn’t have been better to have had dark blue after all. Still⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Well, if you like kedgeree,” Michael interrupted again, “do you like it as much in the morning as you thought you were going to like it the night before?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, how the dickens do I know?” exclaimed Maurice fretfully.</p>
				<p>“Well, will you just eat my breakfast and let me know if you think I ought to have ordered eggs and bacon last night?”</p>
				<p>“Aren’t you keen on the success of this paper?” Maurice demanded.</p>
				<p>“I’ll tell you later on,” Michael offered. “We’ll lunch together quietly in my rooms, and the little mulled claret we shall drink to keep out this filthy fog will also enormously conduce to the amiableness of my judgment.”</p>
				<p>“And you won’t come out with me and Nigel Stewart to watch people buying copies on their way to leckers?” Maurice suggested in a tone of disappointment. Lonsdale arrived for breakfast at this moment, just in time to prevent Michael’s heart from being softened. The newcomer was at once invited to remove the editor.</p>
				<p>“Have you bought your copy of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper"><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.L.G.</abbr></i> yet, Lonny?” Maurice demanded, unabashed.</p>
				<p>“Look here, Moss Avery,” said Lonsdale seriously, “if you promise to spend the bob you screw out of me on buying yourself some soothing syrup, I’ll⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>But the editor rejected the frivolous attentions of his audience, and left the <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">J.C.R.</abbr> Michael, not thinking it very prudent to remind Lonsdale of last night’s encounter with Appleby, examined the copy of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Oxford Looking-Glass</i> that lay beside his plate.</p>
				<p>It was a curious compound of priggishness and brilliance and perspicacity and wit, this olive-green bantling so meticulously hatched, and as Michael turned the pages and roved idly here and there among the articles that by persevering exhortation had been driven into the fold by the editor, he was bound to admit the verisimilitude of the image of Oxford presented. Maurice might certainly be congratulated on the variety of the opinions set on record, but whether he or that Academic Muse whose biographies and sculptured portraits nowhere exist should be praised for the impression of corporate unanimity that without question was ultimately conveyed to the reader, Michael was not sure. It was a promising fancy, this of the Academic Muse; and Michael played with the idea of elaborating his conception in an article for this very Looking-Glass which she invisibly supported. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Oxford Looking-Glass</i> might serve her like the ægis of Pallas Athene, an ægis that would freeze to academic stone the self-confident chimeras of the twentieth century. Michael began to feel that his classical analogies were enmeshing the original idea, involving it already in complexities too manifold for him to unravel. His ideas always fled like waking dreams at the touch of synthesis. Perhaps Pallas Athene was herself the Academic Muse. Well enough might the owl and the olive serve as symbols of Oxford. The owl could stand for all the grotesque pedantry, all the dismal hootings of age, all the slow deliberate sweep of the don’s mind, the seclusions, the blinkings in the daylight and the unerring destruction of intellectual vermin; while the olive would speak of age and the grace and grayness of age, of age each year made young again by its harvest of youth, of sobriety sun-kindled to a radiancy of silver joy, of wisdom, peace, and shelter, and Attic glories.</p>
				<p>Michael became so nearly stifled by the net of his fancies that he almost rose from the table then and there, ambitious to take pen in hand and test the power of its sharpness to cut him free. He clearly saw the gray-eyed goddess as the personification of the spirit of the university: but suddenly all the impulse faded out in self-depreciation. Guy Hazlewood would solve the problem with his pranked-out allusiveness, would trace more featly the attributes of the Academic Muse and establish more convincingly her descent from Apollo or her identity with Athene. At least, however, he could offer the idea and if Guy made anything of it, the second number of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Oxford Looking-Glass</i> would hold more of Michael Fane than the ten pounds he had laid on the table of its exchequer. Inspired by the zest of his own fancy, he read on deliberately.</p>

					<p>Some Reflections. By Maurice Avery.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The editor had really succeeded in reflecting accurately the passing glance of Oxford, although perhaps the tortuous gilt of the frame with which he had tried to impart style to his mirror was more personal to Maurice Avery than general to the university. Moreover, his glass would certainly never have stood a steady and protracted gaze. Still with all their faults these paragraphic reflections did show forth admirably the wit and unmatured cynicism of the various Junior Common Rooms, did signally flash with all the illusion of an important message, did suggest a potentiality for durable criticism.</p>
				<blockquote class="newspaper-title">
					<p>Socrates at Balliol.<br/>
					By Guy Hazlewood.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>There was enough of Guy in his article to endear it to Michael, and there was so much of Oxford in Guy that whatever he wrote spontaneously would always enrich the magazine with that adventurous gaiety and childlike intolerance of Athene’s favorites.</p>
				<blockquote class="newspaper-title">
					<p>The Failure of the Modern Illustrator.<br/>
					By <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C. St. C.</abbr> Wedderburn.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Here was Wedders writing with more distinction than Michael would have expected, but not with all the sartorial distinction of his attire.</p>
				<p>“Let us turn now to the illustrators of the sixties and seventies, and we shall see.⁠ ⁠…” Wedderburn in the plural scarcely managed to convey himself into print. The neat bulk began to sprawl: the solidity became pompous: the profundity of his spoken voice was lacking to sustain so much sententiousness.</p>
				<blockquote class="newspaper-title">
					<p><i xml:lang="la">Quo Vadis</i>?<br/>
					By Nigel Stewart.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Nigel’s plea for the inspiration of modernity to make more vital the decorative Anglicanism whose cause he had pledged his youth to advance, was with all its predetermined logic and emphasis of rhetorical expression an appealing document. Michael did not think it would greatly serve the purpose for which it had been written, but its presence in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Oxford Looking-Glass</i> was a guarantee that the youngest magazine was not going to ignore the force that perhaps more than any other had endowed Oxford with something that Cambridge for all her poets lacked. Michael himself had since he came up let the practice of religion slide, but his first fervors had not burned themselves out so utterly as to make him despise the warmth they once had kindled. His inclination in any argument was always toward the Catholic point of view, and though he himself allowed to himself the license of agnostic speech and agnostic thought, he was always a little impatient of a skeptical nonage and very contemptuous indeed of an unbelief which had never been tried by the fire of faith. He did not think Stewart’s challenge with its plaintive undercurrent of well-bred pessimism would be effective save for the personality of the writer, who revealed his formal grace notwithstanding the trumpeting of his young epigrams and the tassels of his too conspicuous style. With all the irritation of its verbal cleverness, he rejoiced to read “<i xml:lang="la">Quo Vadis</i>?” and he felt in reading it that Oxford would still have silver plate to melt for a lost cause.</p>
				<p>Under the stimulus of Nigel Stewart’s article, Michael managed to finish his breakfast with an appetite. As he rose to leave the Common Room, Lonsdale emerged from the zareba of illustrated papers with which he had fortified his place at table.</p>
				<p>“Have you been reading that thing of Mossy’s?” he asked incredulously.</p>
				<p>Michael nodded.</p>
				<p>“Isn’t it most awful rot?”</p>
				<p>“Some of it,” Michael assured him.</p>
				<p>“I suppose it would be only sporting to buy a copy,” sighed Lonsdale. “I suppose I ought to buzz round and buck the college up into supporting it. By Jove, I’ll write and tell the governor to buy a copy. I want him to raise my allowance this year, and he’ll think I’m beginning to take an interest in what he calls ‘affairs.’ ”</p>
				<p>Michael turned into Venner’s before going back to his own rooms.</p>
				<p>“Hullo, is that the paper?” asked Venner. “Dear me, this looks very learned. You should tell him to put some more about sport into it⁠—our fellows are all so dreadfully wild about sport. They’d be sure to buy it then. Going to work this morning? That’s right. I’m always advising the men to work in the morning. But bless you, they don’t pay any attention to me. They only laugh and say, ‘what’s old Venner know about it?’ ”</p>
				<p>Michael, sitting snugly in the morning quiet of his room, leaned over to poke the fire into a blaze, eyed with satisfaction November’s sodden mists against his window, and settled himself back in the deep chair to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Oxford Looking-Glass</i>.</p>
				<blockquote class="newspaper-title">
					<p>Oxford Liberalism. By Vernon Townsend.<br/>
					A Restatement of Tory Ideals. By William Mowbray.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>These two articles Michael decided to take on trust. From their perusal he would only work himself up into a condition of irritated neutrality. Indeed, he felt inclined to take all the rest of the magazine on trust. The tranquillity of his own room was too seductive. Dreaming became a duty here. It was so delightful to count from where he sat the books on the shelves and to arrive each time at a different estimate of their number. It was so restful to stare up at <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.painting">Mona Lisa</i> and traverse without fatigue that labyrinth of rocks and streams. His desk not yet deranged by work or correspondence possessed a monumental stability of neatness that was most soothing to contemplate. It had the restfulness of a well-composed landscape where every contour took the eye easily onward and where every tree grew just where it was needed for a moment’s halt. The olive-green magazine dropped unregarded onto the floor, and there was no other book within reach. The dancing fire danced on. Far away sounded the cries of daily life. The chimes in <abbr>St.</abbr> Mary’s tower struck without proclaiming any suggestion of time. How long these roll-call mornings were and how rapidly dream on dream piled its drowsy outline. Was there not somewhere at the other end of Oxford a lecture at eleven o’clock? This raw morning was not suitable for lectures out of college. Was not Maurice coming to lunch? How deliciously far off was the time for ordering lunch. He really must get out of the habit of sitting in this deep wicker-chair, until evening licensed such repose.</p>
				<p>Some people had foolishly attended a ten-o’clock lecture at <abbr>St.</abbr> John’s. What a ludicrous idea! They had ridden miserably through the cold on their bicycles and with numb fingers were now trying to record scraps of generalization in a notebook that would inevitably be lost long before the Schools. At the same time it was rather lazy to lie back like this so early in the morning. Why was it so difficult to abandon the Sirenian creakings of this chair? He wanted another match for his second pipe, but even the need for that was not violent enough to break the luxurious catalepsy of his present condition.</p>
				<p>Then suddenly Maurice Avery and Nigel Stewart burst into the room, and Michael by a supreme effort plunged upward onto his legs to receive them.</p>
				<p>“My hat, what a frowst!” exclaimed Maurice, rushing to the window and letting in the mist and the noise of the High.</p>
				<p>“We’re very hearty this morning,” murmured Stewart. “I heard Mass at Barney’s for the success of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper"><abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.L.G.</abbr></i>”</p>
				<p>“Nigel and I have walked down the High, rounded the Corn, and back along the Broad and the Turl,” announced Maurice. “And how many copies do you think we saw bought by people we didn’t know?”</p>
				<p>“None,” guessed Michael maliciously.</p>
				<p>“Don’t be an ass. Fifteen. Well, I’ve calculated that at least four times as many were being sold, while we were making our round. That’s sixty, and it’s not half-past ten yet. We ought to do another three hundred easily before lunch. In fact, roughly I calculate we shall do five hundred and twenty before tonight. Not bad. After two thousand we shall be making money.”</p>
				<p>“Maurice bought twenty-two copies himself,” said Stewart, laughing, and lest he should seem to be laughing at Maurice thrust an affectionate arm through his to reassure him.</p>
				<p>“Well, I wanted to encourage the boys who were selling them,” Maurice explained.</p>
				<p>“They’ll probably emigrate with the money they’ve made out of you,” predicted Michael. “And what on earth are you going to do with twenty-two copies? I find this one copy of mine extraordinarily in the way.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, I shall send them to well-known literary people in town. In fact, I’m going to write round and get the best-known old Oxford men to give us contributions from time to time, without payment, of course. I expect they’ll be rather pleased at being asked.”</p>
				<p>“Don’t you think it may turn their heads?” Michael anxiously suggested. “It would be dreadful to read of the sudden death of Quiller-Couch from apoplectic pride or to hear that Hilaire Belloc or Max Beerbohm had burst with exultation in his bath.”</p>
				<p>“It’s a pity you can’t be funny in print,” said Maurice severely. “You’d really be some use on the paper then.”</p>
				<p>“But what we’ve really come round to say,” interposed Stewart, “is that there’s an <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper"><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.L.G.</abbr></i> dinner tonight at the Grid; and then afterward we’re all going across to my digs opposite.”</p>
				<p>“And what about lunch with me?”</p>
				<p>Both Maurice and Nigel excused themselves. Maurice intended to spend all day at the Union. Nigel had booked himself to play fug-socker with three hearty Trindogs of Trinity.</p>
				<p>“But when did you join the Union?” Michael asked the editor.</p>
				<p>“I thought it was policy,” he explained. “After all, though we laugh at it here, most of the Varsity does belong. Besides, Townsend and Bill Mowbray were both keen. You see they think the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper"><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.L.G.</abbr></i> is going to have an influence in Varsity politics. And, after all, I am editor.”</p>
				<p>“You certainly are,” Michael agreed. “Nothing quite so editorial was ever conceived by the overwrought brain of a disappointed female contributor.”</p>
				<p>Michael always enjoyed dining at the Grid. Of all the Oxford clubs it seemed to him to display the most completely normal undergraduate existence. Vincent’s, notwithstanding its acknowledged chieftaincy, depended ultimately too much on a mechanically apostolic succession. It was an institution to be admired without affection. It had every justification for calling itself The Club without any qualifying prefix, but it produced a type too highly specialized, and was too definitely Dark Blue and Leander Pink. In a way, too, it belonged as much to Cambridge, and although violently patriotic had merged its individuality in brawn. By its substitution of co-option for election, its Olympic might was now scarcely much more than the self-deification of Roman Emperors. Vincent’s was the last stronghold of muscular supremacy. Yet it was dreadfully improbable, as Michael admitted to himself, that he would have declined the offer of membership.</p>
				<p>The <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.U.D.S.</abbr> was at the opposite pole from Vincent’s, and if it did not offend by its reactionary encouragement of a supreme but discredited spirit, it offended even more by fostering a premature worldliness. For an Oxford club to take in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Stage</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Era</i> was merely an exotic heresy. On the walls of its very ugly room the pictures of actors that in Garrick Street would have possessed a romantic dignity produced an effect of strain, a proclamation of mountebank-worship that differed only in degree from the photographs of actresses on the mantelpiece of a second-rate room in a second-rate college. The frequenters of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.U.D.S.</abbr> were always very definitely Oxford undergraduates, but they lacked the serenity of Oxford, and seemed already to have planted a foot in London. The big modern room over the big cheap shop was a restless place, and its pretentiousness and modernity were tinged with Thespianism. Scarcely ever did the Academic Muse enter the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.U.D.S.</abbr>, Michael thought. She must greatly dislike Thespianism with all that it connoted of mildewed statuary in an English garden. Yet it would be possible to transmute the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.U.D.S.</abbr>, he dreamed. It had the advantage of a limited membership. It might easily become a grove where Apollo and Athene could converse without quarreling. Therefore, he could continue to frequent its halls.</p>
				<p>The Bullingdon was always delightful; the gray bowlers and the white trousers striped with vivid blue displayed its members, in their costume, at least, as unchanging types, but the archaism made it a club too conservative to register much more than an effect of peculiarity. The Bullingdon had too much money, and not enough unhampered humanity to achieve the universal. The Union, on the other hand, was too indiscriminate. Personality was here submerged in organization. Manchester or Birmingham could have produced a result very similar.</p>
				<p>The Grid, perhaps for the very fact that it was primarily a dining-club, was the abode of discreet good-fellowship. Its membership was very strictly limited, and might seem to have been confined to the seven or eight colleges that considered themselves the best colleges, but any man who deserved to be a member could in the end be sure of his election. The atmosphere was neither political nor sporting nor literary, nor financial, but it was very peculiarly and very intimately the elusive atmosphere of Oxford herself. The old rooms looking out on the converging High had recently been redecorated in a very crude shade of blue. Members were grumbling at the taste of the executive, but Michael thought the unabashed ugliness was in keeping with its character. It was as if unwillingly the club released its hold upon the externals of Victorianism. Such premises could afford to be anachronistic, since the frequenters were always so finely sensitive to fashion’s lightest breath. Eccentricity was not tolerated at the Grid except in the case of the half-dozen chartered personalities who were necessary to set off the correctness of the majority. The elective committee probably never made a mistake, and when somebody like Nigel Stewart was admitted, it was scrupulously ascertained beforehand that his presence would evoke affectionate amusement rather than the chill surprise with which the Grid would have greeted the entrance of someone who, however superior to the dead level of undergraduate life, lacked yet the indefinable justification for his humors.</p>
				<p>Michael on the evening of the Looking-Glass dinner went up the narrow stairs of the club in an aroma of pleasant anticipation, which was not even momentarily dispersed by the sudden occurrence of the fact that he had forgotten to take his name off hall, and must therefore pay two shillings and fourpence to the college for a dinner he would not eat. In the Strangers’ Room were waiting the typical guests of the typical members. Here and there nods were exchanged, but the general atmosphere was one of serious expectancy. In the distance the rattle of crockery told of dinners already in progress. Vernon Townsend came in soon after Michael, and as Townsend was a member, Michael lost that trifling malaise of waiting in a club’s guestroom which the undergraduate might conceal more admirably than any other class of man, but nevertheless felt acutely.</p>
				<p>“Not here yet, I suppose,” said Townsend.</p>
				<p>It was unnecessary to mention a name. Nigel Stewart’s habits were proverbial.</p>
				<p>“Read my article?” asked Townsend.</p>
				<p>“Splendid,” Michael murmured.</p>
				<p>“It’s going to get me the Librarianship of the Union,” Townsend earnestly assured Michael.</p>
				<p>Michael was about to congratulate the sanguine author without disclosing his ignorance of the article’s inside, when Bill Mowbray rushed breathlessly into the room. Everybody observed his dramatic entrance, whereupon he turned round and rushed out again, pausing only for one moment to exclaim in the doorway:</p>
				<p>“Good god, that fool will never remember!”</p>
				<p>“See that?” asked Townsend darkly, as the Tory Democrat vanished.</p>
				<p>Michael admitted that he undoubtedly had.</p>
				<p>“Bill Mowbray has become a poseur,” Townsend declared. “Or else he knows his ridiculous article on Toryism was too badly stashed by mine,” he added.</p>
				<p>“We shan’t see him again tonight,” Michael prophesied.</p>
				<p>Townsend shrugged his shoulders.</p>
				<p>“We shall, if he can make another effective entrance,” he said a little bitterly.</p>
				<p>Maurice Avery and Wedderburn arrived together. The combination of having just been elected to the Grid and the birth of the new paper had given Maurice such an effervescence of good spirits as even he seldom boasted. Wedderburn in contrast seemed graver, supplying in company with Maurice a solidity to the pair of them that was undeniably beneficial to their joint impression. They were followed almost immediately by Guy Hazlewood, who with his long legs came sloping in as self-possessed as he always was. Perhaps his left eyelid drooped a little lower than it was accustomed, and perhaps the sidelong smile that gave him a superficial resemblance to Michael was drawn down to a sharper point of mockery, but whatever stored-up flashes of mood and fancy Guy had to deliver, he always drawled them out in the same half-tired voice emphasized by the same careless indolence of gesture. And so this evening he was the same Guy Hazlewood, sure of being with his clear-cut pallor and effortless distinction of bearing, the personality that everyone would first observe in whatever company he found himself.</p>
				<p>“Nigel not here, of course,” he drawled. “Let’s have a sweep on what he’s been doing. Five bob all round. I say he’s just discovered Milton to be a great poet and is now, reading <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Lycidas</i> to a spellbound group of the very heartiest Trindogs in Trinity.”</p>
				<p>“I think he saw The Perfect Flapper,” said Maurice, “and has been trying ever since to find out whether she were a don’s daughter or a theatrical bird of passage.”</p>
				<p>“I think he’s forgotten all about it,” pronounced Wedderburn very deeply indeed.</p>
				<p>“I hope he saw that ass Bill Mowbray tearing off in the opposite direction and went to fetch him back,” said Townsend.</p>
				<p>“I think he’s saying Vespers for the week before last,” Michael proposed as his solution.</p>
				<p>Stewart himself came in at that moment, and in answer to an united demand to know the reason of his lateness embraced in that gentle and confiding air of his all the company, included them all as it were in an intimate aside, and with the voice and demeanor of a strayed archangel explained that the fearful velocity of a pill was responsible for his unpunctuality.</p>
				<p>“But you’re quite all right now, Nigel?” inquired Guy. “You could almost send a testimonial?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, rather,” murmured Nigel, with tender assurance lighting up his great, innocent eyes. “I expect, you know, dinner’s ready.” Then he plunged his arm through Guy’s, and led the way toward the private dining-room he had actually not forgotten to command.</p>
				<p>Dinner, owing to Avery’s determined steering of the conversation, was eaten to the accompaniment of undiluted shop. Never for a moment was any topic allowed to oust <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Oxford Looking-Glass</i> from discussion. Even Guy was powerless against the editor intoxicated by ambition’s fulfillment. Maurice sat in triumphant headship with only Mowbray’s vacant place to qualify very slightly the completeness of his satisfaction. He hoped they all liked his scheme of inviting well-known, even celebrated, old Oxford men to contribute from time to time. He flattered himself they would esteem the honor vouchsafed to them. He disclaimed the wish to monopolize the paper’s criticism and nobly invited Townsend to put in their places a series of contemporary dramatists. He congratulated Guy upon his satiric article and assured him of his great gifts. He reproached Michael for having written nothing, and vowed that many of the books for which he had already sent a printed demand to their publishers must in the December issue be reviewed by Michael. He arranged with Nigel Stewart and Wedderburn at least a dozen prospective campaigns to harry advertisers into unwilling publicity.</p>
				<p>At nine-o’clock, the staff of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Oxford Looking-Glass</i>, reflecting now a very roseate world, marched across the High to wind up the evening in Stewart’s digs. On the threshold the host paused in sudden dismay.</p>
				<p>“Good lord, I quite forgot. There’s a meeting of the <i xml:lang="la">De Rebus Ecclesiasticis</i> in my digs tonight. They’ll all be there; what shall I do?”</p>
				<p>“You can’t possibly go,” declared everybody.</p>
				<p>“<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Arbour,” Nigel called out, hurriedly dipping into the landlady’s quarters. “<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Arbour.”</p>
				<p><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Arbour assured him comfortably of her existence as she emerged to confer with him in the passage.</p>
				<p>“There may be one or two men waiting in my rooms. Will you put out syphons and whisky and explain that I shan’t be coming.”</p>
				<p>“Any reason to give, sir?” asked <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Arbour.</p>
				<p>The recalcitrant shook his seraphic head.</p>
				<p>“No, sir,” said <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Arbour cheerfully, “quite so. Just say you’re not coming? Yes, sir. Oh, they’ll make themselves at home without you, I’ll be bound. It’s not likely to be a very noisy party, is it, sir?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no. It’s the <i xml:lang="la">De Rebus Ecclesiasticis</i>, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Arbour.”</p>
				<p>“I see, sir. Foreigners. I’ll look after them.”</p>
				<p>Nigel having disposed of the pious debaters, joined his friends again, and it was decided to adjourn to Guy’s digs in Holywell. Arm in arm the six journalists marched down the misted High. Arm in arm they turned into Catherine Street, and arm in arm they walked into the Proctor outside the Ratcliffe Camera. To him they admitted their membership of the university. To him they proffered very politely their names and the names of their colleges, and with the same politeness agreed to visit him next morning. The Proctor raised his cap and with his escort faded into the fog. Arm in arm the six journalists continued their progress into Holywell. Guy had digs in an old house whose gabled front leaned outward, whose oriel windows were supported by oaken beams worm-eaten and grotesquely carved. Within, a wide balustraded staircase went billowing upward unevenly. Guy’s room that he shared with two intellectual athletes from his own college was very large. It was paneled all round up to the ceiling, and it contained at least a dozen very comfortable armchairs. He had imposed upon his partners his own tastes and with that privilege had cut off electric light and gas, so that lit only by two Pompeian lamps, the room was very shadowy when they all came in.</p>
				<p>“Comeragh and Anstruther are working downstairs, I expect,” Guy explained, as one by one, while his guests waited in the dim light, he made a great illumination with wax candles. Then he poked up the fire and set glasses ready for anyone’s need. Great armchairs were pulled round in a semicircle: pipes were lit: the stillness and mystery of the Oxford night crept along the ancient street, a stillness which at regular intervals was broken by multitudinous chimes, or faintly now and then by passing footfalls. Unexcited by argument the talk rippled in murmurous contentment.</p>
				<p>Michael was in no mood himself for talking, and he sat back listening now and then, but mostly dreaming. He thought of the conversation in that long riverside room in Paris with its extravagance and pretentiousness. Here in this time-haunted Holywell Street was neither. To be sure, Christianity and the soul’s immortality and the future of England and contemporary art were running the gauntlet of youth’s examination, but the Academic Muse had shown the company her ægis, had turned everything to unpassionate stone, and softened all presumption with her guarded glances. It was extraordinary how under her guidance every subject was stripped of obtrusive reality, how even women, discussed never so grossly, remained untarnished; since they ceased to be real women, but mere abstractions wanton or chaste in accordance with the demands of wit. The ribaldry was Aristophanic or Rabelaisian with as little power to offend, so much was it consecrated and refined by immemorial usages. Michael wished that all the world could be touched by the magical freedom and equally magical restraint of the Academic Muse, and as he sat here in this ancient room, hoped almost violently that never again would he be compelled to smirch the present clarity and steadiness of his vision.</p>
